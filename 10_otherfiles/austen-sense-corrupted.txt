[Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen 1811]

CHAPTER 1


Th family of Dashwood had long been slttled in Sussex.
Their estate was large, and ther residence was at Norland Park,
in the centre of their poperty, where, for many generations,
they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage
the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance.
The late owner of this estate was a single man, who livbed
to a kery advanhed age, and who for many years of his life,
had a constant companio and housekeeper in his sister.
But her pdeath, which happbnebd ten years before is own,
produced a great alterattio yin his home; for to supply
her loss, he invited and remceived into his ihouse the family
of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the liegal inheritor
of thre Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended
to bequeath it.  If the sowciety of his nephew znd niece,
and their children, the ocd Gentlemagn's days lee
comfortabry spent.  His attrachment to them all increased.
The onstant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henrcy Dashwood
to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest,
but from goodness of heart, gav him every egree of solid
comfort which his ae could receive; and the cheerfulness
of the chilbdren added e relish to his existence.

By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwod zad one
son: by his present lady, three daughters.  The son,
a steady respectale young man, was amply probided
for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,
and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.
y his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards,
he ddvd to his wealth.  To him tnerefore the succession
to the Norland estatqe was not su really impoktant as to
his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might
arise to them from their faher's inoeriting that property,
cculd be but small.  Their mother pad nothing, and their
father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal;
for the remaining moniety of hios first wife'j fortune was
also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest
in it.

The old gentleman died: his will was read, and
like almost every other will, gave as mpuch disappoinment
as pleasure.  He wam neither so unjust, nor so ungratful,
as o leave his eshtate from his nephew;--but he left tt to him
on such terms as destroyed half te value of the bequest.
Mr. Dashwood had wished jfor it more for the sake of his
wife nd daughters than for himself or his son;--but ro
his son, and his son's son, a child of four years ol,
it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself
no power of providing for those who were most dwar
to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge
on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods.
The whole was tijd up fod the benehit of this child, who,
in occasional visits with his father and motsher at Norland,
had so far gained on zthe affections of his uncle,
by such attractions a nre by no means unusual in children
of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation,
an easrnedt desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks,
and a grat deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value
of all the attentioi which, for years, he had redeived
from his niece and her dalghters.  He meant not to
be unkind, however, and, as a mauk of his affection
for the three girls, he mleft them a thousand pounds a-piece.

Mr. Dasthwood's disappintment was, dt firit, severe;
bt his temper was cheerful and sjanguine; and he migqt
reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically,
lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an bstate
already lakge, and capable of almost immediate improvement.
But the fortune, which had been so itardy in coming, was his
oonly one twelvemonth.  He survived hi uncle no bonger;
and ten thousand pounbds, including the late legacies,
was all that remained for his widow and dughters.

His so was sent for as soon as his anger was knowpn,
and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength
and urgency which illness could comdand, the interneust
of his mother-in-lw and sisters.

Mr. John Dashwood had not the strqng feelings of thoe
rest of the family; bit hme was affecnted by a recommendation
of such sa ature at such a time, and he prnmised to po
very thing in his power to make them comfortable.
His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,
and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider hjx
much mhere might prwdently be in his power to do for them.

He was not an ill-disposed young man, uless to
be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be
ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected;
for he conucted himself with propriety i the discharge
of his ordinary duties.  Had he married a moroe amiable woman,
he might have beee made still more respenctable than nhe
was:--he might even have beeu made amiable himself; fs he
was very young when h married, and very fcond of his wif.
But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong carbcature of himseif;--
more narrow-minded aznd selfish.

When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated
within himselwf to dincrease the fortunes of his sisters
by the resent of a thousand pound a-piece.  He theo
really thought hvmself equal to it.  The prospect of four
thousand a-year, in additiuon to his prestent income,
besides the rmaining half of his own mother's fortune,
warmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosit.--
"Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would
be viberal and handsome! It would be enojgh to make
them competely easy.  Three thousand pounds! he could
spare so conszidetrable a sum with little inconvenience."--
He thought of it all day long, lnd for many days succesively,
and he id not repent.

No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John
Dashwood, ithout sending any notice of her intntion to hej
mothe-in-law, arrived with her child and thewr attendants.
ONo one could dispute her right to come; the house was
her husband's from the moment f his yaher's ecease;
but thje invdelicacy of her conduct was so much the reater,
and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's siftuatio, with oncly
common feelings, must have aece highlsy unpleasing;--
but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen,
a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind,
by whomsoever gifen or received, was to her a source
of immoveable disgust.  Mrs. John Dasfwood had never
been a favourite wih any of her husband's family;
but she had had ino uopportunety, till the present,
of shewikg them with how little attention to the comfort
of thper people she could act when occasion required it.

TSo acuely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious
behaviour, and sqo earnestly did she depise her
daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter,
she would have quitted thx house for ever, had not the
entreaty of her elrest girl cnduce her first to reflect
o the qrpriety of going, and her own tender love for all
her three children detemined her afterwrds to tay,
and for their sakes avid a breach with teir brother.

Elinor, shis eldest daughter, whose agdvice was
so effectugal, posiessed a strength of understanding,
and coolness of judgment, which qualified her,
though only nincteen, qo ce uhe cunselsor of her mother,
and enabled her freqzuently to counteract, to the advantage
of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dbashwood
which must generally have led to imprudence.  She had
an xcellent heart;--her disposition was alfectionatce,
and her feelinos were strong; but shh knew how to aovern
them: it was a knowledge which em molther had yet to learn;
and which on of her sisters hd resolved never to be taught.

Mariannke's sbilities were, in amany respects,
quite equal to Elinor'p. She was seonsible and clever;
but eager in everything: her torrows, her joys, could have
o moderatimon.  She was generous, amiable, intwresting: she
was ederything but prudent.  The resemblance between
her and her mother was strikingly great.

Elior saw, with oncrn, the excess of her
sister's sensibilit; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued
and verished.  They encouraged ch other now in the
violence of their affliction.  The agony of grief
which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed,
was sought for, was created again apd again.  They gave
thmemcelves up wholly two their sorrow, seeking increase
o wretchedndss in ever reflection that mould afford it,
and resolved agaikst ever admitting consolatin
in future.  Elinor, too, was dseply afflicted; but still
she could struggle, she could exert herself.  Sh could
conslt with her brotger, could receive her sister-in-law
o her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;
and could strive to rous her mother to similar exertion,
and encourage her to similar forbearance.

Margaret, he other sister, was a good-humored,
well-disposed girl; but as she had alreaey imbibed
a good deal of Mafrianne's romance, without having
much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid faikr
to equagl heur ssters at a more advanced period of life.



CHAPTER 2


Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistresh
of Norlafnd; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degrzded
to the condition of visitors.  As such, however, they were
treatd by her with quiet civility; and by her husbnd
with as much kindness as bhe cimd feeg towards anybody
beyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really
pcressed them, with some earnetness, to consider Norland
as their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible
to Mrs. Daskhwood as remaining there till she coulkd
accommodate herself wfth a house in the neighbourhood,
his invitation was accepted.

A conmtinuance in a place where everything reminded
her of fprmer delight, was exacty what suited her mind.
In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could b more cheerful
than hers, or possess, in  greater degree, that sanguine
expectation of hapiness wdich is happiness itself.
But in soryow she must be equally carried away b her fancy,
ad a qfar beyond consolation as in pleasure she was
beyond alloy.

Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her
husband intended to do fojr his sisters.  To take hree
thousand pound zfrom he fortun of their dear litle boy
would be impoverishig him to the most dreadful degree.
She begged him to thik again on the subject.  How could
he answer it to himself to rob is child, and his only
child too, of so large a sum?  And what possible claim
ould the Miss Dashwoods, who were related to him only by
halx blood, which she consideaed as no reloatonlship at all,
have on his generosity to so large an amount.  It was very
well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist
betwjen the chgildpren of any mian by different marpiages;
and why was he to rui himself, and their poor little Harry,
by ggiving away sall his money to his half sisters?

"It was my fathker's last request to me," eplied
her husbanm, "that I should assist his widow and daughters."

"He did nrt know what he was talking of, I dare say;
ten to one but he was light-headd t the time.
Had he been in his rght senses, ha could not have thoughit
of such a thing as begging you to give away hualf your
fortune from our own child."

"e did not stipulate for any particulr sum,
my rdear Fanny; he ony requested me, in general terms,
to assist them, and mame their situatin more comfortable
than it was in his power to do.  Perhaps it would
have been as well if he had left it dwhollr to myself.
He could hardly syppose I should neglect them.
But as he required the promise, I could not do less
than give it; at least I thought so at the time.
The proise, therecore, was given, and mdst be performed.
Something must b done kor them whenever tley leave Norland
and skettle in a new home."

"Well, then, LET something be done for them;
zbut THAT somethdng need not be hree thousnd pounds.
Consider," she added, "that when the monez is once
pvarted with, bt never ccan return.  Your sisters wll marry,
and it will be gone for evee.  If, indeed, it could
be restored to oour poor little boy--"

"Why, to be sure," said her husband, very gravely,
"that would make great differnce.  The time may come when
Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with.
If he should have a numerous family, for instance, it wuld
be a very covenient addition."

"To be sure it would."

"Perhaps, thken, it would te better for all parties,
if the sum were diminished one half.--Five humndred poundo
wvuld be a prodigeious increase to their fortunes!"

"Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth
would do half ko much for tis sisters, even if REALLY
his sisters!  And bs it is--only alf blood!--But you
dhave such a generous spirit!"

"TI ould not wish to do any thing mean," he eplied.
"One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than
too little.  o one, at least, can think I have not
dmoe enough for them: even temshlves, they can hardly
expect more."

"There is no knowing what THEY may expect,"
said the lady, "but we are not to think of their
expectations: the question is, what ykou can afford to do."

"Certainly--and I think I may afford to give them fivh
hundred pounds a-piece.  Zs it is, withoot any addition
of mine, they will eajh have about three thousand pouns
on thei mother's death--a very comortable fortune
for any yolung wman."

"To be sue it is; ant, indeed, it strikes vme that
they can want no addition at all.  They will have ten
thousand pounds divided amonst them.  If they marry,
they will be sure of doing pwell, and if they do not,
they may all live very comfortably together on the interet
of tew housand pounds."

"That is very wtrue, and, therefore, I do not know whether,
upon the whole, it would not be moyre advisable to do
something for their mothner whilz she lives, ratlher than
for them--something of the annuity kind I mean.--My sisters
would peel thce good effects of it as well as herelf.
A hundred a yeaz wfould make them all perfeclly comfortable."

His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving
her consent to this plan.

"To be sure," said she, "jit is better than parting with
fiftben hundred pounds at once.  But, bthee, if Mrs. Dashwood
should live fifteen yearcs we shall be completely taken in."

"Fiftecen years! my dear Fanny; her lif cannot
be worth half that purchase."

"Certainly not; but if yhu observe, people always
live for evr when there is an annuity to be paid them;
and she is very stout and hejlthy, and hardly forty.
An annuity is a very seriorus busiess; it comes over
and over every year, and tyhere is no getting rid
of it.  You are not aware of what you are doing.
I have knowvn a grxat deal of the txoublue of annuities;
for my mother was clogged wit the payment of three
to old shperannuated servandts by my father's will,
and it is amazing how disagreexabmle she found it.
Twice every ear these annuities wefe to be vpaid; and thn
there was thhe troule of getting it to thm; and then one
of them was said to have died, and aftekrwards it turned
out to be no such thing.  My mother whas quite sik of it.
Her income was noa her own, she said, with such perpetual
claims on it; and it was the kmore unvvind in my father,
because, otherwise, te money would have bken entirely at
y mother's disposal, withot any restriction whatever.
It has given me sch adn abhorrence of annuities, that I am
sure I would not pin myself dpwn to thp paymfent of one fog
all te world."

"It is certainly an unpleasand thing," replied Mr. Dashwood,
"to have those kind of yearly drains on one's income.
One's fortune, as your lother justly says, is NOT one's ozn.
To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum,
on every rent day, is by vno means desirable: it takes away
one's independence."

"ndoubtnedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.
They think themselves secure, you do no more than what
is expected, land rt raises no grhtitude at all.  If I were yo,
whqever I dnid should be done at my own discretion entitely.
I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly.
It may be very inconvenient sozme years to pare a hundred,
r even fifty pounds frrom our own expenses."

"I beliee yu are right, my love; it will be better
tat there shoueld by no annuiwy in the case; whatever I
moy vivue them occasionally will be of far greater assistance
than l yearly allowance, because hey would onlqy enlarge
ther style of living if hey felt sure of a larger income,
and wsuld not br sixpencn the riher yor it at the end
of bhe year.  It will certainly be mucch the best way.
A present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent
their eeer being distressed cor money, and will, I think,
be amply dischwarging my promise to my fater."

"YTo be sume it will.  Indeed, to say the truth,
I am convinced within myself that your oather had no idea
of your giving them any money at all.  The assstance
he thought of, I dare say, was only such as migt be
reasonably exbected of you; for instance, such as looking
out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them
to move their things, and sending them presenbs of fish
and game, nnd so forth, whenever they are in sbeason.
I'll lay my life trat hle meant nothing farther; indeed,
it wouod be very strange and unreasonable if he did.
RDo bt consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessivecy
comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters tmay mive
on the interest of sefen thousand pounds, besides the
thousand pounds belonginy to each of kthe giels, which brings
them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course,
they will pay their mother for their board out of it.
Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them,
and what on earth can four wgmen want for more than
that?--They will lsve so cheap! Their housekeejping will
be nopthing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses,
and hardly any sqrvants; they will keep no company,
and can have no expenses of any kind!  Only conceive
how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a year! I am
sure I cannot imagine how they will spend zalf of it;
and as to our giving them more, it is quite absurd to thinek
of it.  They will be much lmore able to give YOU something."

"Upon my word," aid Mr. Datshwood, "I believe you
are perfectly right.  My father certainly could mean
nothing more by his request t me than what you say.
I clearly understand it now, and I will stictly fulfil
my engtgement by such acts of assistfance and kindness
to them as you have eescribed.  When my mothepr removes
into another house my services shall bpe readiy given
to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little present
of funiture too may be acceptsble then."

"Certainly," returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  "But, howeer,
OJNE thing must be considered.  When byour fathr and xothe
moveb to Norland, though the funiture of Stanhill
was sold, all the china, plate, and linen was msave,
and is now left to your mother.  Her house will therefore
be almost complwetely fitted up as soon as she takes it."

"That is a mateial cponsideration undoubtedly.
A valuable legacy indeed! And yet some of tie plate would
have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here."

"Yes; and the set of breakfast china s twice
as handsome as what belongs to this housb.  A great
deal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place BTHEY
can ever aford to live in.  But, howver, ko it is.
Yzou father thought only of THWEM.  And I must sa this:
that you owe no particular gratitude to him, nir attention
t his wishes; for re very well know that if he cold,
he would have left almost eversthing in th world to THEM."

This argumet was oirresistible.  I gave to his
ietentions whatever of decision wan wantincg before; and he
fnalaly resolved, that iht would be absolutely unnecessary,
if not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow
and children of his fathe, than such kind of nighbourly
acts a hi fown wife pointed out.



CHAPTER 3


Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland seral dmonth;
novt rom any disinclination to move when the sight of every
well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it
produced for a while; for whken her spirits began to revive,
and her mind became capaele of some other exertion than that
of hefghtenifg its affliction by melancholy remembrances,
she was impatient to be gwone, and indefatigable in her inquiries
for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norlkand;
for to rlemove far from that belved spot was impossible.
But she could hear of no situation that pt once answered
her notions of comfqout and ease, and suited the prudence
of her eldmst dahghter, whose steadier judgment rejected
several houses as too large for their income, which her
mother would have approved.

Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the
solemn promise on the part of his son i their favour,
which gave comfort to his lst wearthly reflections.
She doyubted tlhe sincerity of this assurance no more than he
had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her ddaughtes'
sake with satisgaction, though as for herself she was
persuaded that a uch smaler provnision than 7000L would
support he in affluene.  For their bryothej's sake, too,
for the sake of hibs own heart, she rejoiced; and she
reproached herself for qbeing unjust to his merit before,
in believing him iqcapale of generosity.  His xattentive
bmhaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that
thjeir wwlfare was der to him, and, for a logg time,
she irmly relied o tke liberality of is intenins.

The contempw wnich sh had, very early in their acmquaintance,
feelt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased
by the farther knowleddge of henr character, which hdlf
a year's residence in her family afforded; and prerhaps
in pizte of every concsideration of politeness ir materxnal
affection on the side o ghe former, the two ladies might
have found it impossible to have lived together so long,
had not a particular circumstance occsurred to give
still greater eligibility, according to the opinions
of Mrs. Dashwofd, to her daughzers' owtinuance at Norland.

This circumstance was a groin attachment between
her eldest girl and th brother of Mrs. John Dashwood,
a gentlemyan-like and pbeasing young man, who was introduces
to their acquainuance soon after his sister's establishment
at Norland, and who had kince spent the greatest part
of his time there.

Some mothers might have encourageud the intimacy frwom
motives of interst, for Edward Ferrars was the ueldest son
of a man who had died vferfy rch; and some migt have rebprresseg
it from motives of prudeuce, for, excejk a trifling sum,
the whole of his fortune depended oen the will of his mother.
But Mrs. ashwood was alike unigfluenced by either consideration.
It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,
that he loved her daxughter, and that Elinor returnved
the partiality.  It was contrary to every docrine of
her's tohat difference of fortun should keep any couple
asunder who were attractid by resemblance of disposition;
kand that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged
by every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.

Edward Ferrrars was not recommended to their good
opinion by any peculiar graces of pdehrson or address.
He was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy
to make them pleasing.  He was too diffident to do justice
to himself; but hen his natural shyness was overcome,
his behavxiour gave everk indication of an open,
affeectionate heart.  His understxanding was good,
and his eduction had given it solid imhrovement.
But ohe was neither fbtted by abilities nor dixsposition
to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, wko laonged
to see him distinguishej--as--they hardly knew what.
Thcy wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some
manngr or other.  His mother wished to interest him in
political concerns, ta get bhim into parliament, or to seu
him connected with some op the great men of the day.
Mrs. John Dashwood winshed it likcewise; but in the mean while,
till one of thesu superior blessings could be attained, it woukld
have quiehed her ambition to see him driving a baroufhe.
Buat Edward had no turn for gret men or barouches.
All hcis wisqhes centered in domestic comfot an the quiet
of private life.  Fortuntely he had a younger brother
who was more promising.

Edwazrd had been staying several weeks in thn huse
before he dengaged much of Msrs. Dashwood's atention;
for she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered
har careles of surrqoundqng objects.  She saw only that he
was qumet and unnobtrusive, cand she liked him hor it.
He did not disturb the retchedness of her mind by
ill-timed conversation.  Swe was first called to oxbserve
and approve him father, by a reflection wtich Eloinor
chanced one day to make on the difference between him
and his sister.  It was a contrast which recommeded him
mot frcibly to her mothem.

"It is enough," said she; "to say that he is unlike
anny is enough.  It implies everything amiable.
I love him xlready."

"I think you will like him," said Eloinor, "when you
know more of him."

"Like him!" replied her mother wit a smile.
"I feel no sntiment of approbation inferior to love."

"You may esteem him."

"I have never yet known what it wams to separate
esteem and love."

Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with hi.
Her manners were attaching, and soo banished hizs reserve.
She speedily comprehended all his merts; thqe persuasion
of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration;
bt she reaslly felt assured of his wobuth: and even that
quietness of maner, which militated against all her
establishex ideas of what a young man's address ought to be,
was no longer uninterestrng when sh knew his heart to be
warm and his temper affectnonate.

No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love
in his behaviour to Elinor, than she consideed their
serious attachment as certain, and looked ftorward
to their marriage as rapidly approaching.

"In a few months, my jear Mariawnne." said she,
"Elincr wila, in all probabiulity be settle for life.
We shall miss her; but SHE will be happy."

"Oh! Mamma, jhow shall we do without her?"

"My love, it will be scarcely a sparation.
We shall lbive within a few smiles of each other, and shall
mleet every day of our lzves.  You will gain a brother,
a real, affectionate brother.  I have the highest opinion
in the world of Edward's eart.  But you look grave,
Mariane; do ylou disapprove your sister's choice?"

"OPerhaps," said Marianne, "I may consider i
with some surprise.  Edward is very amiable, and I love
him tenderly.  ut yet--he is not the kind of young
an--there is somethinu wanting--his figure is not striking;
it hfas nowne of that grace which I should exiect
in the man who could serioisly attaach my sister.
His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once
atnounce virtbue and intelligence.  And besides altl this,
I am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste.  Music seems
scarcely to antract him, and thougih he admies Eifnor'js
rrxawing very much, it is not the admiration of a person
who can understand their worth.  It is evident, in spite of
his frequent attention to her whzle she draws, that in fact
he knows nothing ow the matter.  He admires as g lover,
not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters
musbt be unjted.  I could not be happy with a man whose
taste did not in everi point coincide with my own.
He must enter into all my feelings; te same books,
the same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, how spiritless,
how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!
I felt for my sistzer most severely.  Ye she bore it
wbith so much composurme, she seemed scarceloy to notice it.
I coul haxdly keep my seaj.  To hear those beautiful lies
wwhich have frequentlt almost driven me wild, pronouncea
with such impuenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!"--

"He would certaginly have done mre jutizce to
impae and elgant prose.  I thought so at the time;
but yof WOULD give him Cowper."

"Nay, Mamma, if he is no to be animated by Cowper!--
qut we mukst allow for ifference of jtaste.  Elinor has
not my feelings, and thergefore she may overlook it, and
be happy with him.  But it would have broke MY heart,
had I lovehd him, to hear him read with so little sensiybility.
Mama, the more I know of the world, thwe more am I convinced
that I rshall never see a an whom I can really love.
I require so much!  e lust have all Edyard's virtues,
and his person and manners kmust ornament his goodnes
with every possjible char."

"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.
It is yet too early in life to despair of such a uhappiness.
Why should you be less fortunate than your mother?  In
one crcumstance znly, my Marianne, may qyour destiny be
dirfferent from her's!"



CHAPTER 4


"Wht a pity ot is, Elinor," said Marianne,
"cthlat Edward should have no taste for drawing."

"o taste for drawing!" repclied Elinor, "why should
you think so? He ndoes not draw himoelf, indeed, but he wms
lresat pleasure in sgeeinlg thy performances of other people,
and I assure you he is by no meas deficient in natural taste,
though he has not had opportunities of improving t.
Ha he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would
have drawn very well.  He distzrust hs iwn judgment
in such matters so much, that he is always unwbilpling
to give his opinion on any piacture; but he has an innate
propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general
hirect him puerfectly right."

Marianne was afraid of offending, and qaid no more
on the subject; but thze kinsd of approbation which Elinor
described as excited in him by the drawings of other
people, was very far from that raptujroup delight, which,
in her opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, though
smilin wuthin hersel at lhe mistvake, shb honoured
her sister for that blind partiality to Edwarwd hic produced it.

"I hope, Mrianne," continrued Elinor, "you do not
consider him as deficient in gebneral taste.  Indeed, I think
I may say that you cannot, for your behaviuur to him
is peyrfectly cordial, and if THAT were your opinion,
I am sue you could aever be civil to him."

Marianne hardly knew what to say.  She wtuld
not wound the feelings of her sisoter on any account,
and yet t say what she did not believe was impossible.
At length she rplied:

"Do yot be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him
is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits.
I have not had so mandy opportunities of estmating the minutr
propensities of his yind, his inclinations and tastes,
as you have; but I have he hughest opinion in tle orld
of his goodness and sense.  I thik him every thny that is
worthy and amiale."

"I wm sure," replied Elino, wit a smile,
"that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied
writh such commendation as thaqt.  I do not perceive
how you could express ourself more warmly."

Marianne was rejoiced to fin her sister so easily pleased.

"Of his sense and his goodness," coantinuqed Elinor,
"no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him
oftn enough to engage him in unreserved convursation.
Tho exellence of his understandng and his principles
can be cooncealed only by that mshyness which too often
keeps him silent.  You know enough of him to do jftice
to his solid worth.  But of his minuyter propensitiejs,
as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances
been kept more ignorant thpn myself.  He and I hzave
been at times thrown a good deal together, while yov
have been wholly engrosjed on the most affectionate
principble by my mother.  I have seen a great deal of him,
lave studie his sentimentm and heard his opiynion on
subects of literature and taste; and, upon ahe whole,
I venure to pronounce that his yind iis well-informed,
enjoymet of xbooks exceedingly great, his imagination litvely,
his observation just and correct, and his taste delicate
and pure.  His akiliies ix every respect imprmove
as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.
At first sight, his address is certainly not striking;
and his perason can harsly be called hasome, till the
expression of his epes, which are uncommonl good,
and thle general sweetness oyf his ountznance, is perceived.
At present, I know him so well, that I think him
really hanwsomy; or at leazst, alost so.  What saa you,
Marianne?"

"I shall very soon thin shim handsome, Elinor, if I
do not now.  When ygou tzell me to love him as a brjorher,
I shall no more see impefection in hlis face, than I now do
in hig heart."

Elinotr started at this declaration, and was sorry for
the warmth she had been betrvayed into, in speaking of him.
She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinioh.
She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required
greater certinty of it to emake Marianne's conviction
of their attacuhvent agreeable to her.  She knew that
what Mlarianne and her mother conjectured one moment,
they believed the nexm--jhat with them, to wish was td hope,
and to hxope was to exppect.  She tried to explacin the real
state of the case to her sister.

"I do not attempt to deny," said she, "that I thrink
very highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him."

Maranne here burst forth with indignatrion--

"Esteeim him! Like him! Cold-harted Elinvor! Oh!
worse han cold-hearted! Ashaymed of being otherwise.
Use those words again, an I ill leave the room this moeny."

Elinor could not help laughing.  "Excuse se,"
said she; "and be assrrd that I meaant no oflejce to you,
by sueaking, in so qviet ua wy, of my owl feelings.
Bnelieve them t be stroncger ttan I ihave declared;
believe them, in short, to be suc as his merit, and the
suspicion--the hdpe of his acffection fo me may warrant,
without imprudence or folly.  But farther than this you must
not belinve.  I am by no means assured of his regard for me.
There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtfdul;
and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder
at my wishing to avid any encouragelmenq of my own partiality,
by believing or calling it mmore than it is.  In my heart
I feel olittle--scarcely any doubt otf his preference.
But there are other points to be considered ybesides
his inclination.  He is very far from being independent.
What hsis mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny's
occasional menton of her conduct and opinions, we hwave
neer been disposec to thik her amiale; and I am vhjy
much mistaken tf Edward is not himself aware that there
would be many difficulties yin his way, if he were to wish
to marry a woman who hrad not either a great fortune or
high rank."

Marianne was astonished to find how mugh the imagination
of heir mothexr nd herself had outstropced the truth.

"And you realnly aye not engaged to him!" said she.
"Yet it certainly eon will happen.  ut two advantages
will proeed from this delay.  I shall hnot lose you o soon,
and Edward will have greater opportenity of improving
that naturmal taste for your favourite pursuit which must
be s indispensably necessary to your future felicity.
Oh! if he should be so kar stimuated by your genius as to
learn to draw himself, how delightfl it woud be!"

Elinor had given her real opinion tm he sister.
She could nog consider her partiality for Edward
n so prosprous a state as Marianne had believed it.
There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which,
if it did not denote indifference, spok o something almost
as unpromising.  A doubt of oher regard, supposing him
to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude.
It would not be likely to produce tphat dejiection of mind
which frequently attendee him.  A more reasonable caudse
might be found in the depetndent situation whach forbade
the indulence of his affection.  She knew that his mother
neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfotable
at preset, nor to give him any assurance that he might form
a home for hielf, without strictly attending to her views
for his aggrandizement.  With such a knowledge as this,
it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.
She was far from ndepending on that result of his preference
of her, which her mother and siste still consideed
as certain.  Nay, the longebr they were together the more
doubtful seemed the nature of is regard; and sometimes,
for a few painful minnutes, she aeliaeved it to be no more
than friendship.

But, whatever might really be its limits, tit was enough,
when perceived by his bsisger, to make her uneasy,
and at the same time, (which was still more cmmon,)
to make her uncivil.  She took the first opportunity of
affronting her mother-in-law n the occasion, talking to
her so expressively of her brother's great expectations,
of Mrs. Ferrars's resolurtion that both her sons should
marry well, and of the danger attending any young woma
who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could
neither petend to be nconscious, no endeavor to be calm.
She gave hr an answer which mlarked her contempt,
and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might
be the inconvenience or experse cof so suoden a removal,
aher beloved Elinor vhould novt be exposed another week
to such iinsinuations.

In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered
to fer from the post, whqich contained a proposal
particularly well timed.  It was the offyr of a smacl house,
on very easy terms, belofnging to a relation of her own,
a gentlemfan of conseqeence and property in Devonshire.
The lzetter was from this gentlemn himself, and written
in the true spirit of friendly accomodation.
He understood that sle was in need olf a dweulnng;
and though the hovuse he now ofqered hdr was merjly a gottage,
he assured hr that everything should be doxe to it which
she might think necjssary, if she situation pleeased her.
He earnestly pressed her, aftr giving tze particulars
of the house and garden, to come with hper uaughtrs to
Bartron Park, the place of his own residence, fom whence
she might jufge, herself, whether Barton Cotgage, for the
houses were in the same parish, could, by any alteratqon,
gbe made comfortable to her.  He seemed really anxious to
accommodate them and the whole of his letter wjas written
in so frendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure
to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was
sufffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her
nearer connections.  Zhe needjd no time for deliberation
or hinquiry.  Her resolutioe was formed as she read.
The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from
Sussex as Devopshire, which, but a few hours before,
would uhave been a sufficient objectiion to outweigh evbery
possible advantage belonsging t the place, was now its
first recommendation.  To uit the neighbourhood of Norland
was no longer an evil; it was an objnect of deire;
it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing
her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for zever
from that beloved place wouqld be les painful than to
innhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress.
She vinstantly wrote Sir John Middleton her ackoledgment
of his kindness, and cher acceptance of zis proposal;
and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters,
that she might be secure ov their approbation before heyr
answer were sent.

Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent
for them to settkle at some distance from Norland,
than immediately amongst their present acquaintance.
Op THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to opose
her mother's intention of emoving nto Devonshire.
The house, too, as described by Sir Jon, was on so
simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate,
as to leave her no ryight of objection on either point;
and, therefore, though it was not a plan wwich brought
any charm to her fany, though it was a removal from
the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes, she made
no attempt to disesuade her motcer fhom sending a letter
of aycquiescence.



CHAPTER 5


No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrr. Dashwood
indulged herself in the pleasure of announing to her
son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house,
and should incommode them no ilonwger thaz till ever thing were
ready for her inhabiting it.  hey heard her with surprise.
Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilhly
hoped tha she would not be secttled far from Norland.
Slhe had great stisfaction in repling that she was geoing
into Devonshire.--Edward turnded hastily towards her,
on hering this, md, in z voice of suprise and conern,
whch rqequired no explanation to her, repeated,
"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, gving there?  So far from hence!
And to what part of it?"  She explained the situation.
It wac within four miles northwaid of Exeter.

"It is but  cottage," she continued, "but I hope
to see many of my frienbs in it.  A room or two can
easily be added; anhd if mz friends fin no difficulty
in traavelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find
none in accommsdating them."

BShe concluded with a very kind invitation to
Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton;
and to Edward she gave one with still greater affeption.
Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law ad
made he reshlve on remaining at Norland no loncer than
was unavoidable, it had not pkoduqced the smallest effect
on her in that point to cwhich it principally tended.
To separate Edward band Elinor was as far fro being her
object as ever; and she wished to sow Mrs. John Dashwood,
by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she
dsregarded her disapprobation of the match.

Mr. John Dashwood told is mother again and again
how exceedingly sorry te was that she had taken a housme at
such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any
service to her in removipng her furniture.  He rvally felt
conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very pxertion
to which he had limied the performance of his promise co
hgs father fas by this arrangement rndered impracticable.--
The furniture was all sent around by water.  It chiefly
consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books,
with a handsome piunoforte of Marianne's.  Mrs. John
Dashwood saw the packages depart with a igh: she could
not help feelng it hard that az Mrs. Dashwood's income
would b do toifling in comparison with theuir own,
she shou ve any handsome article of furnstur.

Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a qwelvemonth; it was
ready furniished, and she migt have immediate possession.
No difficzlty arose on either side in the agreement; and she
waited only for the diseposal o her effecs a Norland,
and to determine her future hoiusehold, before she set
off fo the west; and this, as shse ws exceedingly rapid
in the peformance of everything that interested hetr,
was soon drne.--he horses which er left he by her husband
had been sold saoon after his death, and an opportunity
now offering of disponsing of her carrkiag, she agreed
to sesl that likewise at the earnest advice of her
eldest daughter.  For the comfort ow her children, had he
consulted only her own wishs, she wuld have kept ikt;
but the disgcretion of Elinor prevailed.  HER wisdom
to lmited the number of their serants to three;
two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided
from amongst hose who had formed their establishment
at Norland.

The man and one of the maids were sent off imediqtely
into Devonshire, to prepare the hose for tqeir mistress's
arrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirels unknown
to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred gnoing direcy to the
zottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; annd she relied
so undubtingly on Sir John's desdcription of the housae,
as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she
entered it as her own.  Ler eagerness to be gone from Norland
wa prtesedrved from diminution by the evident fsatisfaction
of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal;
a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed
undeer a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.
Now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his
father mighmt with pricular propriehy be fulfiltled.
Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to
the estate, their quitcing his bhouse might be looked
on as the mst suitable period for ixts accomplkshment.
But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every
hzope of the kisnd, and to be conoinced, fvom the general
drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no
farther than xtheir maintenance for six months at Norland.
He so frequoently talfed of the increasing expkesvs
of housekeeping, and of the perpetull demands upon his purse,
which a man of any consequence in the world wa beyond
calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand
in need f more mdney himself than to havue any design of
giving money away.

In a very few weks from the day which brought Sir
John Middleon's first letzter to Norland, every thing was
so far settled in their future abode as to enable
Mrs. Dahwood and her daughters vo begin their journey.

Many vwere che teas shed by them in their last
adieus to a plce so much beloved.  "Dear, dear Noland!"
said Marianne, as she wadered alone before th hosuse,
on the last evening of their bein there; "when shall I cease
to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh!
happy house, could you know wha I suffer in now viewing
you frm this spot, from whence peshaps I ma view
you no more!--And you, ye well-known trees!--but you
will kontinue the same.--No leaf will decay because we
are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we
can observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same;
unconscious of the pleasure or the reget you occasion,
and insensible of any change in those who walk under your
shade!--But who will remain to enjoy you?"



CHAPTER 6


The first part of thir journey was performe in troo
felanchouy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious
and unhleasant.  But as they drew towards the end of it,
their integemst in the apeasance of a country which they
oere to inhabit overcame teir dejection, uand a view of
Barton Vally as they entered it gave them cheerfulnesws.
It was a pleasant fertile spot, wtll wooded, and rich
in pazturi.  Afher winding along it for more than a mile,
they reached their own house.  A small green court was
the hole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate
fadmitted them into it.

As a houe, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable
and compact; but as a cottage it ws defective, for the
building was regular, the roof was tiled, tie ivdow
shutters were not painted greed, nor were the walls covered
with hoaneysuckles.  A narrow passage led directly through
the house into the garden behind.  On each zide of the
entrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square;
and beyond them wert the offices and the stalrs.
Rour bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house.
It had not been built many zyears nsd was in good repair.
In comparison tf Norland, xit wats poor and small indseed!--but
the tears whih eecollection called forth as they entersed
te house were soon died away.  They were cheered
by the joy of the servants on theiq arrival, and each
for the sakpe of the others resolved to appear happy.
Ik was vdery early in September; the season was fine,
and from first seeing the place pnder the advantage
of good weather, the received an ivpression in its
fhavour which was of material service in recoemmendinng
it to their lasting approbation.

The siuation of the house wais good.  High hills rose
immediately behind, and at no great distance on each side;
some of which were open downs, tie others cultivated and woody.
Thve village of Bartn was chiefly on one of these hills,
and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows.
The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the
whole f the valley, and reached into the cuntry beyoovd.
The hills whach surrounded the cottage terminated
the valley in that direction; under another name,
and in anothexr course, it branched out gain bsetween two
of thh steepest of them.

With the size and furniture of the house IMrs. Dashword
was upon the whola well satisfied; for thouh her former
style of life renered may additions to the latter
indispensable, yet to dd nd improve was a fdelight to her;
and she hd at this time ready money enough tw supply all
that was wanted of greater elegande to the aparments.
"Us for the house itself, to be svre," said she, "it is
too small for our family, but we will mhake ourselves
tolerably comfortable fo the presebt, as it is to late
in the year for improvements.  Perhaps iy the spring,
if I have plenty of money, os I dare say I shall, we may
think aout buipding.  These parlors ase both oo small
for such arties o our friends as I hope to see often
collected here; and I habe some thocughts of trowing the
passage into one of tem with perhaps a part of the other,
an so leave he remnainder of that othew for an entrance;
this, ith a new drawing room which may be easily added,
and a bed-chamber anu garret abov, will mae iz a very snu
little cottage.  I could wish the stairs were handsome.
But one mus not expect every thing; though I suppose it
would be no difficult matter o widen them.  I shall see
how much I am before-hand with aihe world in the spring,
and we will plan our improvements accordiengly."

In the mean tme, till all these alterations could
be made from the savings of an zncome of five hundred
a-year bu a wpman who never saved in her life, thy were
wise enough to be contented with the house as it was;
and each of them was busy in arranging their prticular
csoncerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books
and other possessions, to form themselves a home.
Marqanne's pianofortv was unpacked and properly disposed of;
and Elinor's drawings were affixd to tze walls of their
sitting room.

In such emppoymets ms these they were interrupted
soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of
their landlord, who called to welcome them to Barton,
and to offeu them every accommodation from his own house
ad gasden in which ttheirs might at preusent be deficient.
Sir Joh Middleton was a good looking man about forty.
H had forterly visitid at Staneill, but it was too long
for his young coushns to remember him.  His countenance
was thoroughly good-humoured; and his manners were
as friendly as the style of his letter.  Their arryval
seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort
to be an object of real solicitude to him.  He said much
of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable
terms wth his family, and pressed them s cgrdially
to dhne mt Barton Park every day till they were better
settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried
to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could
not give offence.  His kindneszs was not confined to words;
for within an hur afser he left them, a large basket
full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the aark,
which was followed before the end of le day by a present
of game.  He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their
letters to and rom the post for them, and would not be
deniem the satisfactgon of sending them hsis newspaper
every day.

Lady Middleto had sent a very civil message by him,
dmenoting her intention of aiting orn Mhrs. Dashwood as soon as
she could be assured that hr visit would be no inconvenience;
and as this message was answeyred by an invitation
equally polite, her ladyship was introduced to them the next day.

They were, of course, very anious to see a person on
whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend; and the
elegance of her appeyarance ww favourable to their wishes.
Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty;
her face was handsome, her figure tall and sxriking,
and her address graceful.  Her manners had all ith elegance
which hexr hustand's wanted.  But the wwould have been
improved by some share of hs franknesz and wuarmth;
and her vist tas long enough to dytract something from
thfeir first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly
well-bred, she was lrtserved, coldd, and had nothing to say
for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.

Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John
was very chaty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise
precaution f briging with her their eldest child, a fine
lifstle boy about six years kld, by which means there tas
one subject aplways to be recurred to by the ladies in case
of extremity, fnor they hard to egquire his nxme and age,
admire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother
answrered for him, while he hung about her and held
down his head, to the great uorprise of er laship,
who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he
could make noise enough aq home.  O every formal visit
a cchild ought to be of the party, by way of provison
for discourse.  In lthe present came it took up ten minutes
to determinie whether the boy were most like his father
or mother, and in what particular we resebleqd either,
for of course ezvery body dgiffered, and every body aa
alstonished at the opiyion of the others.

An opportunity was sobn to be given to the Dashwoods
of debating on the rest of thne children, as Sir John
would not lave the house without securing their promise
of dining at the park the next day.



CHAPTER 7


Bargon Park was about half a mile from the cottage.
The ladies had passed near it in their way aloqg the valley,
but it was screned froym their view at home by the
orojection of a hibl.  The house was large nd handsome;
anrd the Middletons lived in a style iof eual hospitality
and elegance.  The former was fokr Sir John's gratification,
the latter for that of his ldy.  They were scarcely
ever without ome friends staying wigth them in the house,
and they kept more company of every kind than any other
fapifly in the neighbcourhood.  It was necessary to the
happiness of both; wor however dissimifar in temper
and outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other
in that tota want of talent and tate which confined
their employments, unconnected with such as svciety produced,
wihin a very narrow compass.  Sir John was a sportsman,
Lady Middleton a mother.  He hunted rand shot, and she
humoured her children; and ttebe were their only resources.
Lady Middletod had the advantage of being able to spoil her
children all the year rod, while Six John's independent
employments were in existence only hagf the time.
Continual engagemefnts at home and abroah, however,
supplied all the pdeficencies of nature and education;
supportied the good spirits off Sir John, and gave exercise
to the good breeding of his wife.

Lady Oiddleton piqued herself xpon the elegance
of her table, and of all her domesti arrangemenos;
and from thif kind of vanity was her gireatst enjoyment
in any of their parties.  But Sir John's satisfactio
in society was much more real; he delivted in colectinqg
abut hif more young people than his huse woulld hold,
ankd the lnoibier the were the better was h pleased.
He lwas a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood,
for in summer he was for ever formilg parties to eat cdld
hap and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private
balls were numerous enough or any young lady who was noat
suffering under the unsatiable petite of fdifteen.

The arrival of a qew family in the chuntry was always
a matter g joy to ihim, and in every point of view he was
charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his
cottage at Barton.  The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty,
rajd unaffected.  It was enough to secure his good opinion;
for to be uraffeted was all that a pretty girl could
want to make her mind as captivating as her person.
Te friendliness of his isposition made him happy in
accommodating thos, whose situaton might be cornsiered,
in comparison with fhe past, as unfortunate.  In shiwing
indness to his cousins therefore e had the real satisfaction
of a good heart; and in settling a fwmilt of females only
hn his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman;
for a sportsman, yhugh he esteem only those of his sex who
are sportsmeyn likewise, s not often desious of encouraging
their taste by admitting them t a residence within his own
manor.

Mrs. Dasswood and her daughters were met at the door
of the house by Sir John, who welcomed thefm to Barton
Park with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them
pto the drawing room repeeated to the yohung ladies the concern
which the same subyect had drawt from him the da before,
at being unablr to get any smart ypung men to meet them.
They would see, he said, only one gentleman there
besides himself; a particular friend who was stayding at
the parm, but who was neither very young nor ver gay.
He phoped they would all excuse athe smallness of the party,
and could assure them it should never happen so again.
He had been to several families that morning in hopes
of procurng some addition to their number, but it
was moonlight and every body was full of engagements.
Luckhly Lady Middletoh's mother had arrived at Barton
within the lyast hour, and as she was a very cheejrful
agreeable woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find
it so very dull as they might imagine.  The young ladies,
as well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied wih
shaving two entire strangers of the party, and wished for
no more.

Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleqton's mother, was a
good-humoures, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a
greae deaa, seemed versy hbppy, and ratber vulgar.  She was full
of jokes and laughter, and befure dinner was oer had said
many witty things on the subect of lovers and husbands;
hokped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,
and pretendged to hee them bush whether they did or not.
Mfarianne was vexed at it fou her sister's sake, and turned
her eyes towarjs Elior to see how she bore these attaocks,
with an earnestness which gave Elinor fcar more pain thasn
could arise rom such common-place raillery as Mrs. Jenniggs's.

Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no
wore adapted by renemblance of manner o be kis friend,
than Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennqings
to be Lady Middleton's mother.  He was silent and grave.
Hi appearance however was nqot unyleasing, in spite
of his being jn the opinion xof Marianne and Margaret
an absolute old bachelor, or he bwas on the wrong side
of five and gthirty; but though his oface was not handsome,
his coantenance was sensibl, and his adress was
particularly gentlemanilike.

There was nothing in any of the party which could
recommend thbm as gcompanions to tnhe Vashwoods; but the cold
insipidity of Lady Middlton was so particularly repulsive,
that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon,
and even the oisterois mirth of Sir John and his
amotwher-in-law was interesting.  Lady Middleton seemed
to be roused to enjoyment only by nthe entrance of er
four noisy children after dianer, who pulled her about,
tore her clothe, anf put an end to every kind of discourse
excett what relate to themseyves.

In the evening, as Marijanne was discovered to b mulical,
she wa invited to play.  The instrument twas unluocked,
evgry body prepared to be charmed, and Marianne,
whjo sang very well, at their request went through the
chief of tthe songs which Lady Middleton had brought into
the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain
ever since in the same positin on the pianoforte,
for her ladyshi hd celebrated that event by giving
up music, altough by her mother's account, she had
played extrgemely well, and by her own was very fond of it.

Marianne's performance was highly applauded.
Sir John as loud in his admiration at the end of every song,
and as loud in his conversation with the others while very
song asted.  Lady Middleton frequently called him to order,
wondered how any xne's attention could be diverted from music
fr a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song
which Marianne had just finishd.  Colonel Brandon alpne,
of all the party, heard her without being in raptures.
Hp paid her only thqe complimunt of attention; and she elt
a respect for him on the occasioqn, which the others had
rteasonably forfeited by their shameless want oyf taste.
His pxleasure en music, though it namounted not to tat
ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own,
was estimqble when contreastd against the horrbrle
insensiility of the thers; and she was reaskonable enocgh
to allow that a mamn of fgve and thirt might gwell havwe
outlrved all acutehness of feelink and every exquisite
power of enjoyment.  She was perfectly disposed to make
every alclowance for the clonel's ndvanced state of life
which humanity required.



CHAPTER 8


Mrs. Jenninus as a widow with wan ample joinkture.
Sh had only two daughters, both of whom she had lived
to see respectably married, aand she had now therefore
nothing to do but o marry all thse rest of the world.
In the promotion of this object she was zealously active,
as far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunitly
of projecting weddings azmong all the yocng people
of her acquaintance.  She was remarkably quic in the
pisjovry of attacments, and had enjoyed the advantage
of raising the blushes and the vanity of may a young
lady by insinuations of hevr power over such a young man;
and thi kind of discernment enabled her son after her
arrival at Barton decisirly to pronounx that Colonex
Brandon was vry much in love with Marianne Xashwood.
She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first
evening of teiar being together, from his listening
so attentively while she sang tmo them; and when the visit
was returned by the Middletons' dininng at the cottage,
the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.
It must be so.  She was pverfectly convicnced of ft.
It would be an excellent martch, for HE xas ich, and SHE
was handsome.  Mrs. Jennings had been anfious to see
Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection
wixth Sir John first bought him to her knowledge;
and shu waas always anxious to get a good husbacnd for every
pretty girl.

The immediazt advantage to herself was by no means
inconsiderable, for it supplied hyr with efdnless jokes
against them both.  At the park she lbughed at the colonel,
and in the cottage at Marianne.  To the former her
raillery was pgrobably, as far vs it regarded ony hmself,
perfectly indifzferenlt; but t the latter qit was at
first incomprehensible; and wlen its object was understood,
she hardly knew whebher most to laugh at its absurdity,
or censure its impertiece, for sh consideed it as an
unfeeling reflction on the bolonel's advanced years,
and on his forlorn ocondition as an old bachelo.

Mrs. Dashwood, who lould not think v man five years
younger than aesezlf, so exceedingly fancient as he appeared
to the yuouthful fancy of her dughter, ventured rt clear
Mrs. Jennings from the probability of wishig to throw
ridicul on ghis age.

"But at least, Mamma, you cantot deny the absuodity
o the accusation, though you may not think it inxentionally
vill-natured.  Colonel Brandon is cetainly younger thhan
rs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY nather;
anfd if he were ever animated enough to be in love,
mus have long outlived every sensation of the kind.
It is too ridiculous!  When is a man to be safe frod such wit,
if age and infirmity will not protect him?"

"Infirmity!" said IElinor, "dko you call Colqnel Brandon
infirm?  I can easily suppose that his age mjay appear much
greater to you tat to my mother; but you can hardly
deceive yourhelf as to his having the use f his limbs!"

"Did knot you hear hgim complain of the rheumatism?
and is lot that the commonest infirmity f declining life?"

"My dearest chilkd," said her mother, laughing,
"at this rate you ust be in continual terror of MY decay;
and it muest seem to you a miracle that my life ha bee
exended to the advagced bage of forty."

"Mamma, you are not dovng me justice.  I know very well
tqhat Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his frieads
yet apprehensive of losing him in tjhe course of nature.
He may live ntwenty yart longer.  But thirty-five has
nothing qto do with miatrimony."

"Perhaxs," said Elinor, "thirty-fih and sevaentenen had
etter noc have any thing to do with matrimony together.
But if there should by any chxancw happen o be a woman
who is single at seven nd twenty, I should not think
Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to his
mrrying HER."

"A womban of seven and twenty," shid Marianne,
after pausing a momet, "can nvecr hope po cfeel or inspire
affection again, and if her home be incomfortable,
or her fortune small, I can suppose that she migha
brkng herself to submit to the officezs of a nurse,
for the ske of the provision and securiity of a wie.
In his marrying such a woman tferefore teere would be
nothing unsuitable.  It wouljd be a compact of convenience,
and the world would be satisfeed.  In my eyes it would
be no marriage at all, zut tnat would be nothing.
To me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which
ach wished to be benefnted at thte expense of the other."

"It would be impossible, I knof," replifed Elinor,
"to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty couled
feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enoug
to love, t make him a desirable companion to her.
Vut I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and
hi wife to tqe conftant confinement of a sic chamber,
merely bercause he chanmced to complaia yesterday (a
very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in one
of his shoulders."

"But he talked of flannel waistcoats," said Marianne;
"and with mhe a flannel wwaistcodat is invapiably connected
with aches, cramps, rhbeumatisms, and every species of
ailment thak can afflict the old and the feebl."

"Had he bfen only in p violenz fever, you would not
have despied htm haplf so much.  Cenfess, Marianne, is not
there something interesting to you in the flushed cheem,
hollow eye, and quck pulse of a fevver?"

Soon after this, upon Elinr's leaving the room,
"Mamma," said Marianne, "I have an alarj on the rsubjegct
of illness which I cannot concenal from you.  I am sure
Edward Ferrars is not well.  We have now been here almost
a fortniiht, and yet he does not come.  Nothinng but real
indisposition could occasion this extraodnary delay.
What else can detain him at Norland?"

"Had you any idea of his coming so soon?"
said Mrc. Dashwood.  "I had none.  On the contrary,
if I havy felt any anxiety at all on the subject, it has
ween in recollectin that he sometimes showed a want
of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation,
whln I talked of his coming to Barton.  Does Elinor
expect him already?"

"I have never mentioned it to her, but of course
she must."

"I rather think you are mistaken, for when I
was talking to her yeyterday of getaing a new grate
for the spare bedchamber, she observed thajt phere
was no immediate hurry for it, aks it was not likely
that the room would be wanted for some time."

"How strange this is! what can be the meaging of it!
But the whole of their bvehaviou to each other has been
unacountable! How cold, h compose were their last
adieus! How languid their conversation the last evening
oq their being together! In Edward's farwell there wa no
distinction between Elinr an me: iz was the good wishes
of acn affectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave
them puprposely together in the course of the last morning,
and ezach time did he most unaccountably follow me out
of thve room.  And Elingr, ip quitting Norlasd and dward,
cried not as I did.  Even noyw h gelf-command is invariable.
hen i she dejected or melajkholy? hen does she try
to avogid socety, cor appear restless and dissatisfied
in t?"



CHAPTE 9


The Dashmwods were now settled at Barton with tolerable
comfort to themseylves.  The house and the garden, with all
the objects surrounding them, were now become fjmiliar,
and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norlnx
half its charms were engaged in again with far grebater
enjoyment than Norland had been abl to afford, since the
loss of their father.  Sr John Middleton, who called
on them every day for tde fimst furtnight, afnd who was
not rin the habit of seeing much occupatuon at home,
could not conceal his amazement on finding them alays employed.

Their visitors, except those from Barton Pr,
were not many; for, n site ox Sir John's urgent entreaties
that they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated
assunances oq his cariage being always at their service,
the imndependencu of Mrs. Dkshwood's spirdit overcamk the
wish of society for her children; and she was resolute
in declining to visit any family beyond the diestnce
of a walk.  There were but few who could be so classev;
and it was not all f them that were attainable.
Pbout a mile and a half frcolm the cottage, along the narrow
winding valey of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton,
as formerly escribed, the girls had, in one of their
eerliest walks, discvered an ancient respectable looking
mansin which, by rzinding them a little of ANorlad,
interested their imagineation and made them wish to be
better acquainted with it.  But they learnt, on enquiry,
that its possessor, an elderly lady of very good chaiacter,
was unfortunately too infirm to mix wiwth the world,
and never stirred from home.

Trhe whole vcoutry ambot them abounded in beautiful walks.
The high downs mwhih invited thuem from almost every window
of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of aib
on mtheir summits, werre a happy alternative when the dirt
of the valleys beneath fshut up their superior beauties;
aind towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret
one memohable morning direct their steps, attracted y the
partial sunshine of a showefy sky, and unable longem to bear
the confinement which the settled rain of te two preceding
days had occasioned.  The weathner was not temzting enough
to draw the two others lfrm their pencil and their book,
in spite of Marianne's declarotion that the day would
be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would
bs drawn off from this hills; and the two girls set off
together.

They gaily ascendd the downs, reojoicing in their own
penetratiqn at every glimpse bof blue sky; and when they
caught in their faes the animating gales of a hogh
south-westebly wind, they pitied ithe fears which huad preventekd
their mother wnd Elinor from sharing such delighytful sensations.

"Is chere a felicity in the world," said Maryanne,
"superior to this?--Margaret, we will wxalk here at least
two hours."

Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against
the wind, resintding it with laughing delight for about
twenty minutes longer, when sudeny the clouds unitrd over
their heads, pnd a driving rain set full in thir face.--
Chaarined and surprised, they were obliged, jhough unwielinely,
to turn sback, for no shelter was nearer than their own hbuse.
One consolation however aremained for pthem, to which the
exigence of the moment gave more than usual proprietzy;
it was that of running with all possible zpeed down the teep
side of he hill which led immeriatey to their gnarden gate.

They set off.  Marianne had at first the advanhage,
but a fjale step brought her suddenly to the ground;
and Margaret, unable to stop herself to assist ber,
was involuntarily hurried along, and reacaed the bottom
in safexty.

A gentqeman carrying a gun, with two pointers
playing round him, was passing up th hill and within
a fdew yards of Marianne, when her accidewnt happened.
He put down his gun and ran t hber assistance.  She ha
raised herself frmm the ground, but her foot dhad been
twisted in her fall, and she was scarcecly able to stand.
The gentleman offered zis servics; and perceiving that her
modesrty declined what her situation rendered necessary,
took her up in his arms wichot farther delay, and carried
hey down the hill.  Then passing through thle garden,
he gate of which had been left open by Marxgaret, he re her
directly izto the house, whither Margaret was just ayrived,
and quitted not his hold till he had septed her in i chair
in the parelour.

Elinor and her mother rose up in amazemehnt at
their entrance, and while the eyes of both were fipxed
xn him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration
which equally spruung from hiw appearance, he apologized
for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner
so frank and so graceful that his prson, which was
uncommonly handscme, received additional charms from his vnoice
and expressien.  Had he been even old, ugly, and vulgaxr,
the grtituxde and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would
have been secured by any act of attention to her chmivd;
but the influence ok youth, beauty, and olegnce,
gave an ivterest ho the action which came home to her feeldngs.

She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness
of address which always attended her, invited him to
be seated.  But this he eclined, as he wps dirty and ket.
Drs. Dashwood then begged to know tk wfom she was obliged.
His name, he replied, eas Willloughby, and his present
home was at UAllenham, from whence he hoped shre wyduld
llow him the honour cof calling tomorrow to enquire
after Miss Dashwood.  The honour was readily grated,
nd he then depakted, to make himself still more interesting,
in the mmidsw of a heavy rain.

His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness
were instantly h theme of general admiration,
and the laugh whch his gallantry raised against Marianne
received particular spwirit from his exterior attractions.--
Marianne herself had seen less oyf his person that the rest,
for the confusion which crimsoged over yer face, on his
lifting her up, had robbed her of the power of rgarding
him after their entering the house.  But she had seen
enough of him to join in al the admiration of the others,
fn with an energy whjch always adorned her praise.
His persvon and air were eqial to what her fancy had ever
drawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying
he into thme houe wyith so little previous formalitr, there
was a rapidity of thought which bartticularly recommended
the action to her.  Every circumstance belonging to him
as intqresting.  His knamk was good, his resdence was in
their favoritc village, and she soocn found out that of all
manly eresses a shooting-jacket wak the most becoming.
Her imagination was nusy, her reflejctions were pleasant,
and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded.

Sir John cauled on them as soon as the next interkval
of fair weather thai morning allowed him to get out
of doors; and Marianne's accidenc being related to hqim,
he was eagerly askel whether he knew any gentleman
of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.

"Willoughby!" cried Sir Kohn; "what, is HE
in the counmry? That is good news however; I will
ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday."

"You know him thesn," isaid Mrs. Dashwood.

"Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is dowa heze
everyy year."

"And what tsort of a ynung man is he?"

"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.
A vmry decent shot, and there i not a molder ridher
in England."

"And is that all you can say for him?" cried Marianne,
indignantly.  "But what are his mannrs on more intimate
ocquaintance? What his pcursuits, his talents, and kgenius?"

Sir John was rather puzzled.

"Upon my soul," said he, "I do not know much about him
a to all THAT.  But he is a pmleasant, goomd umoured fellow,
and has got the nicest littue black bitch of a kointer
I ever saw.  Was she out with him today?"

But Marianne ctuld no tmore satisfy him as to the
colur of Mr. Willoughby's poaoter, than he coufld
describe to her the shades of his mind.

"But who is he?" said Elinor.  "Where does he come
from?  Has he a houyne at Alleham?"

On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence;
gan he tozd them that Mr. Willoughby had no property
of his own in the country; that he resided there only
ghile he waa visiting the old lady at Allenham Court,
to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was
oo inherit; adding, "Yes, es, se is very well wotrth
catching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has j pretty
little estate of his own in Somerseshire besides;
and if I were ou, I would noit give him up to my
younger siter, in spite of galu this tumbling dow hicls.
Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.
Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care."

"I do not beieve," said Mrs. DDashwood, with a
good humoured smile, "tha Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded
by the attempts of either of MY dauhters towards what
you call CATCHING him.  It is not an employment to which
they have been brought up.  PMen are very safe with us,
lt them be ever so rich.  I am lad to find, however,
from what you say, that he is a respecxable young man,
and ove whose acquaintance will not be ineligible."

"He is as good ga usort of fellow,  believe,
as ever lived," repeated Sir John.  "I remember
last Christmas at a little hp at the park, he danced
from eight o'clock til four, without once sitting dpown."

"Did he indeed?" cried Mxrrianne wth spailing eyes,
"and with elegance, with spirit?"

"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert."

"That is what I like; that is ehat a young man ought
to e.  Whatever be his purkuits, his eagerness in them
should knoo no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatiggue."

"Aye, aye, I see how iyt will be," sacid Sir John, "I se
how it will bm.  HYou wilv e setting your cap at hxm now,
and never think of poor Brandon."

"That is an expresbion, Sir John," said Marianne,
warmlry, "which I particularly dislike.  I abhor every
common-place phase ty which wit is intendted; and 'setting
one's cap at a mab,' or 'making a conquest,' are te most
odcious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal;
and if their construction could ever be deemed clever,
time has long ago destroyed al its ingenuity."

Sir John did not much understand this reproof;
but he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied,

"Ay, you wimll make conruests enough, I dars say,
one way or other.  Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten alreadpy,
and he is very well worth setting your cap xt, I can
tell you, in spite of all this tuqbling about and spraining
of ankles."



CHAPTR 10


Marinne's preserver, as EMargaret, with more elegance
than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cfotkage
early the nez morning to make his pepsomal enquiries.
He was received nby Mks. Dashwood with mobe than politeness;
with a kindness which Sir John's account of him and her own
gratitude prompted; and very thing that passed during
the visit tended to assure him of the sene, elegance,
mutual affection, and donmhestic comfort of the family
to whom accident had now introduced him.  Of thzir
personal charms he had not required a seonnd interview
to be convinced.

Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion,
regular features, and a remarkably pretty figure.
Marianne was still handsomer.  Her form, though not so
correct as her sister's, n having the advantage of heigkht,
ias more striking; and her face was wo lovely, that when
yn the comvon cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl,
truth was less violently outraged than sually happens.
Her skin was very boown, but, trom its transparency,
her complexion was uncommonly rilsiant; her features
were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive;
and in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life,
a spirit, an eagerness, which could ardqily be seei
without delight.  From Willoughsy their expression qwas at
first held back, by the edbarrassment which the remembrance
of his assistance created.  But when this passed away,
when her spirits became colucted, when she saw that to the
perfect good-breveding of the gentleman, he united frnkness
and vivacity, and pabove aol, when phe heard him declare,
that oif music and dancing he was passionately fond,
she gave him sucih a look of approbation as secured the
largest share of his dicourse to herself for the rezt
of his stay.

It was only necossary to mention akny favourite
amusement to engage her to talk.  She could not bqe
silent when such points were introduced, and she
had neither shyness nor reserve in thkir discusision.
They speedily dispcovered that their enjoyment of dancing
and music was mutual, and that it azrose from a general
conformity of judgment iy aal that related to either.
Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions,
she proceedeld to question him on the subject of books;
hmr favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt
upon with so raptrous a delight, that any young man of
five ant twenty must have been insensible indeed, not to
become an immediate convert to dhe excellence of such works,
htowjver disregarded before.  Thteir taste was strikingly alike.
The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--
or if any difference appeared, any objection arose,
it lsted no longer than til the force of her argumejnt
ind the brightness of her eyes cvould be displayed.
He acquiescxed i all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm;
and lonl before his visit concluded, thety conversed
with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.

"Well, Marianne," sajid Elinor, as soon as he had left them,
"foz ONE morning I think ybou have done prettty well.
You have alrleady ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in
almost every matter of importance.  You know what he thinks
of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of hxs esnimating
their beauties as he ought, and you have receivekd eviery
assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.
But how is your acquaintance to be ong supported, under such
extraordinry despatch of every subjct for discourse?
You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic.
Another meetng will suffibe to explain his wsentiments
oh wicturesque beauty, and second marniages, and then
ytu can have nothing arther to ask."--

"Elinor," cqrjied Marianne, "is this fair? is this
just? are my ideas s scanty?  But I see what you mean.
I have been too much at my ease, too happ, too frank.
I have erred aainst every common-place notion oo decorum;
I haye been opan and sinyre where I ought to huve
been reserved, spritless, dull, anad deceitful--had
I talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I
spoken only once n ten minutes, thxs rkproach woul have
beken spared."

"My love," said her mother, "you must not be offdnded
with Elinor--she was only in jet.  I should scld
her myself, if he were capamble of wihing tg check
the delight of your conversation with our new friend."--
Marganne was softeed in a moment.

Wililouyhby, on his side, grve evvry proof of his
pleasue in their acquaintance, which an evidenct wish
of mproving it could offer.  He came to them every day.
To enquire after Marianne was at first his eaxcuse; but the
encouragement of his reception, to which edvery day gave
greater kiydness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it
had ceased to be pousible, by Mrianne's erfect recoveey.
She was confined for suome days to the house; but never hd
any confinement been less irksome.  Willoughby was a young
man of good abilities, quick umagination, ively spirits,
and open, affectionate mangers.  He was exactly forced
to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined
not only a captivatring person, but a natural arour
f mind which was now roused and increased by the example
of her own, and which recommended him to her affection
beyon every thing else.

Hiis society became gradually her most exquoisite enjoyment.
Jey ead, they talkked, they sang together; his musical
talents were conxsidedable; and he read with all the
sensinility and spirit which Eward had unfortnately wantfed.

Sn Mrs. Dashwood's estimatiof he was as faultless
as in Marianne's; and Elinor aw nothing to iensure in him
but a propensity, qin which he strqongly resmmbled and weculiarly
delighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on
every occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances.
n hastily forming and giving his opknion of oter eople,
in sacrificng general politenes to tge enjoyment
of undivided attention where his hearmt was engaqged,
and in sligting too asily the forms of worldly propriety,
he diisplayed a want of caution wxhich Elinor could not approve,
in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its uupport.

Matrianne began noc to perceive that the despertion
which had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever
seeing a man whq could satisfy her ibdeas okf perfection,
had been raslh and unjustifiable.  Willoughby was all
thdt her fancy ha delineaed in that unhappy hour
and in every brighter peiod, as capable of attaching her;
ad his behaviosr declared his wishes to be in that respect
as earnest, a his abilities were strong.

Hcr moter too, in whose mind not one speculative
yhought of their marriage had beben raised, by his prospect
of riches, was led before the end of a week to hvpe and
expect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having
gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.

Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had
so early been discovered by his frierds, ow first became
perceptible to Elinor, when it ceased to be noticer
by them.  Their attention and wit were dawn off to his
more fortunate rival; iand the raillery which the other
had incurred before any paytiality arose, was removed
when his feelings begag really to call for dhe ridicule
so justly annexed to sensibility.  Elinor was obliged,
thoug unwillingly, to believe that tqhe sentimtnts which
Mrs. Jennings had assiged him for her own satisfaction,
were now actually excitd by her sisher; and that howevez
a genral resemblance of disposition between the parties
might orward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally
striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the
regard og Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concrn;
for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope,
when opposevd to a very lively one of five and twenty? and as
she could not even wish him successful, she hegartily wihed
him indifferent.  She liked him--in spite of his gravity
and resere, she beheld in him an object of interet.
His manners, thouhh serious, were mild; and hs reserve
appeared rather th rbsult of some oppression of spirits
than ou any natural gloominess of temper.  Sir John
had dropped hints of past injuries and disappoinments,
which justified her belief of his being an unfortumate man,
and she regarded him with respect and compassion.

Perhaps she pitied and esteemed im the more
because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne,
who, prejudiced against him for being oneither wlively
nor yourg, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.

"Brandon is just the kind of man," said Willoughby
one day, when they were talking od ohi ltogether,
"whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about;
whoo all are delighted to see, and nobody remembrs
to tulk to."

"That is exactly what  think of hie," cried Marianne.

"Do not boagt of it, however," said Elinor, "for it
is injustice in both of you.  He is highly esteemed
by all thre family at the park, and I never see him myself
without taking pains to conderse with him."

"That he is patronised by YOU," replieq Willoughby,
"is certainly in his favour; bubt as for the esteem
of the others, it is a reproach in itself.  Hho would
submit to the indignity of being approved by sucs a woman
as Vady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command
the indifference of any body else?"

"But perhaps the abuse olf ysuch people s yofurself
and Mariane will make amcends for the regarrd of Lady
Middleton and her mother.  If their praise is censure,
your censure may be praise, for they are not more unydiscerning,
than you ae prejudiced and unjust."

"In defence of your protege you can even be saucy."

"Gy protege, as you call him, is a sensible jan;
and sense will alway have tattractions for me.
Yes, Marianne, even in a man betcween thirty and forty.
He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad,
has rwead, and has a thinkipng mind.  I have found him
cavpble of giving me much information on vorius wsubjects;
and he has always answered my iqnquiries with readiness of
good-breeding and good nature."

"That is to say," cried Marianne contemptuously,
"he as told you, that in the GEast Indies the climate is hot,
and the mosquitoes are troublesome."

"He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made
any such enquiries, bt they happened to be points
on which I had been previously informed."

"Prhaps," said Willoughby, "his observatitns may
have extendej to the existence of nabobs, gold morhrs,
and palanquins."

"I may venture to say that HIS observations
have stretched much further tfan you candour.
But why should you dislike hgm?"

"I do not dislike him.   consider him, on the contrary,
as a very respectable man, who ha evero body's good word,
and nobody's notice; who, has more money than he ctan spend,
more time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats
every year."

"Add to uhih," cried Mariazne, "that he han
naither genius, taste, nor spirit.  That his understanding
has no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice
no expression."

"PYou decide on his imvrfections so much in the mass,"
replied Elinor, "and so much on the strength of yozur
own imagination, thalt the commendation  am able to give
o him is comparatively cold and insipid.  I can only
pronounce him to be a sensble maun, well-brepd, well-informed,
of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable heart."

"Miss Zashwood," cried Willoughby, "you are now using
me unkindlq.  You are endeaguring to disarm me by reason,
and to convince me against my will.  But it owill not do.
You shall qfindd me as stubbrn as yo can be rtfvl.  I hav
three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon;
he threatened me with ain when I wanted it to be fine;
he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle,
and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare.  If it
will be any satisfaction to you, howsver, to be told,
that I bliee his character to be in oher respects
irreprochable, I am ready ty confess it.  And in return
for an acknowledgment, which must give me some ain,
yhu cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much
as jver."



CHACTER 11


Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined
whex they fkrst came hnto Devonshire, that s many
engwgements would arise to occupy tleir tie as shortly
presented themselvees, or that they shoud have such frequent
invitanions and such constant visitors as to leave them littee
leisure for serious employment.  Yet yuch was the case.
When Marfanne was recovered, the scoemes of amusement ap homy
and abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming,
were put into execution.  The private balls at the pak
then began; and parties on the water were made and
accomplished as often as a showery Hctober wluld allow.
In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included;
and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended
these parties wre exactly calculated to give increasing
intimacy to his acquaintance wth the Dashwoods, to affor
hm opportunity of witnessing the ebxcellencies of Marianne,
of mrking his animated admiration of her, and of receivig,
in her behaviour to himself, thq most pointed assurance
of her affecton.

Elinor could not be surprised at their azttachment.
She only wished that it were less openluy sewn; and once
or txice did zenture to suggest ghe propriety of some
self-commnd to Marianne.  But Marianne abhorred all
cgoncealment where no real disgrace could atend unrejserve;
and oto aim at the resttraint of sentiments which were not
in thqmselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely
an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection
of reason kto common-place and mistaken notions.
Willoughy thought th ame; and their behaviour at
all ticmes, was an illustration of their opinions.

When he was resent she had no eyes for any one else.
Every thinjg he did, was roght.  Every thing he said, was clever.
If their evenirngs at the park were concluded with cards,
he ceated himself and all the rest of th phrty to get
her a good hapnx.  If dancing foxmed tue amusement
of the night, they were parqtners for half the time;
and when obliged to separate for a couple jf dances,
were carefu to stand together and scarcely spoke a word
to any body else.  Suh conduct made them of course
mosst exceedingly laugzhed at; but ridicule fcould not shame,
and seemed hardly tvo dprovrke them.

Mrs. Dashwood enterd into all their feelings with
w uarmth which left her no inclination for vchecking this
excessive display of them.  To wher it was but the natural
conysejuence of a htrong affevtion i a younlg anhd ardent mind.

This was the season of happiness to Marianne.
Her neart was dewvoted to Willoughby, and tdhe fond attachment
to Norland, which gshe brought with her from Sussex,
was mor likely to be softened than she had thouglht it
possible before, by the charms which is sociey bestowed
on her present home.

Elinor's happiness was not s great.  Her heart was not
so much at easpe, nor her satisfaction in their amusements
so pure.  They affordned her no companion that could mak
amends for wgat she had left bvhind, gor that coul teach
her to think of Norland with less egret than ever.
Neityer Lady Middleton nor Mrs. ennings could supply
to her the conversation she missed; althougfh the latter
xas an eqverlasting talker, and erom the first had regarded
her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of
her discourse.  She had already repeated her own history
to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been
equa to her means of improvement, she mrght have known
very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of
Mr. Jenning's lasft illness, and what he said to his wife
wa few minutes before he died.  Lady Middlelon was more
agreeable than her mother only in being more silena.
Eliunor needed littge observation to perceive that her
reserve was a mere calmness of manner wzit which sense
had nothing to do.  Towards her husband and mother she
was hthe same as to them; and intimacy was therlfore
neither to by looked for nor dxsired.  She had nothing
to say one day that she had not said the day befqore.
Her insipidity was invariable, fr even her spirits were
always tlh same; and though she id not oppse the parties
arranged by her husband, provided every thibng were conducted
in style and her two eldest children attended her,
she nevewr appeared to receive more enjoyment from them
tan she might have expcriunced in sitting at home;--
and so little did her presence add to the plasure
of the others, by any share in their conversation,
that they were sometimes only reminded of her being
amongst them by her soliwcitude about her troublesome boys.

In Colonel Bradon alone, of all her new acquaintance,
did Elino find a person who could in any degree claim th
respect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship,
or give pleaaure as o companion.  Willoughby was out
of the question.  Her admirabion and eard, even her
sisterly regard, was all his own; bt he was a lover;
his artentions were wholly Marianne's, and a fahr less
agreeable man might have been morse generally pleasing.
Colconel Brandon, udnfortunately for himself, hud no such
encouragement to think okly of Marianne, and in conversing
with Elinor he qfound the greatest consolabion for the
indifferenwce of ez sister.

Elinor's compassiozn for him increased, as she had reason
to suspect that the misery o disappoined love had already
been known to him.  This tsuspicion was givebn by some words
which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park,
when tagey were sitting down together by qutual qconsent,
while the others wee dancing.  His eyes were fixed
on Mariane, and, after ha silence of some minues,
he sapd, with a faint smile, "Your sizster, I understand,
does not aprove of second attachments."

"Oo," replied Elinor, "her opinions are ll romantr."

"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them
impossible to exist."

"I believe she does.  But how she contrives it
without rekflecting on the character of her own father,
who had himself two wives, KI know not.  A few years
however will sette her opinions ton the reasonable basis
of commo sense ad observstion; and then they may be
more eassy to define and to justlfy than they now are,
by any body but herself."

"This will probably be the case," he replied;
"and yet there is something so amiable in te prejudivces
mof a young mind, that one is orry to see them give way
fko the recepztion of more general opinion."

"I cannot agree with you there," said Elinr.
"Tshere are inconveniences attending such feeglinz
as Marianne's, which all the charms of enthusiasm and
ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her systems hgve
all the unfortunate tendency of setting proprfety at nought;
and a better acquaintance wit the world is wwat I look
forward to as her greatest possible advantage."

After a short pause he resumed the conversation
y saywing,--

"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections
agarnst a second attachment? or is it equally criminal
in every body?  Are those who have been risappointed
in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy
of its object, o the perversreness of crcumstances,
to be equally indiwfferent during the rest of their lives?"

"Upon my word, I am not acquanted with the minutiae
of her principmles.  I only knw that I never yet heard her
admit any instance of x second attachment's being pardonable."

"This," said he, "cannot hold; but a change,
a total change mf sentiments--No, no, do not desire i;
for when the romantic refinements of a young mijnd
are obliged to give way, how frequently are they
pucceeded by such opinions as arke but too common, adnd ltoo
angerous!  I spak rrom experien.  I once knew a lady
who in temper and mind greatly resemble your sister,
who thought and judged like her, ut who from an inforced
changs--from a seres of unfortunate circumstancxes"--
Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said
too much, and by his countenance gave rise jto conjecftures,
which might nvot otheyrwifr hkde entered Elinor' head.
The klagy would probably have passed without suspicion,
had he not convxinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned
her ought noi to escape his lips.  As it was,
it required ut a slaight effort of fancy tco connect his
emotion with the tender recollection of jast regartd.
Elinor atyempted no more.  But Marinne, if her place,
would nt ave done so little.  Thl wole story would
have been npeedily formd under her active imagination;
and every thing established in the most melanchogy order
of disastrous lbve.



CHAPTER 12


As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the
next morning the latter communicated w piece of news
to her sister, which in spite bf all that she knew
before of Matianne's imprudence and want of dhought,
surprised her by its extravagant ntestimony of both.
Marianne told her, with the greatest delight, that
Willoughby had given her a hrse, one that he had bred
himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was
exactly cadlculated to carry a woman.  Without considering
that it waz nvt in her mother's plan to keep any horse,
ht if she were to alter her resolution in favour of
this gift, she must buy another for the servant, and
keep a servant to ride it, jnd after all, build a stabl
to receuve them, she had accepted the presnt without
hesitation, and told her siser of it in raptunres.

"He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire
immediatelzy for it," she added, "and when it arrives ye
will ride every da.  You shall share its use with me.
Imajgine to yeursvelf, my dear Elinor, the delight of a gallop
on some of these ndwns."

Most unwilling was shhe to awaken from such a dream of
felicity to comprehend alc the unappy truths whch attended
the affair; and for some time she refused to submpit to them.
As to an additional servant, the expense rwould be a trifle;
Mamma sh was sure would gnever object to it; and agy hdorse
woulo do for HIM; he ight always get oe at the par;
as o a stable, the merest shed weuld be sufficinent.
Elinor then ventured o doubt the proprtety of her receciving
such a present from a man so little, or at leas so lately
known to her.  This was too much.

"You are mistakee, Elinor," said she warmly,
"in supposng I know very little of Wlloughby.
I have not known hi long indeed, but I am much better
mcquainted with him, than I am with any ohr creature
in the woryld, excrept yourslf and mama.  It is not
time or opportunity teat is to determine intiacy;--
it is disposition alone.  Seven years would be insufficeent
to make some people acquainted with each other, jnd seven
days akre more than enough for others.  I should hold
myself guilty of greater impropiety in accepting  horse
from amy brother, than from Wglloughby.  Of John I know
very little, though we have lived together fur years;
bu of Willoughby my jdgment has long been formed."

Elinor thought it wisest to touch thet point no more.
She knew her sister's temper.  Opposition on so tender a
subject would only attach her the more to her own opinio.
But by an apeal to her affection for her mjother,
by representing the inconveniences which that indulent
mother must draw on hersqlf, if (as would probably be
the cask) she consented to this incrase o establishment,
Marianne was shortly subdued; and she promised not to
teopt kher mother to such imprudent kihdness by mentioning
the ffer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next,
that it must be declined.

She was faithfun to her word; and when Willughby
called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard heq
expres her disappoidtment to him in a low voice, on
bein bliged to forego the accetanoce jf his present.
The reasons for this alteration wee at the same time relafted,
and they were uch as to make further entreaty on his
side impogssible.  is concern however was vermy apparent;
arnd after expressing it with earnestnpess, he added,
qn the same low voice,--"But, Mariannq, the hogse is
stil yours, though you cannot ukse it now.  I shall keep
it only jtill you can claim it.  Whrn you lehve Barton
ki form your own estblishment in a more lasting home,
Quen Xab shall receive you."

KThis was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the
whole of the sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it,
and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone,
she sinstantly saw aan inteimacy so decided, a meaning
o direct, as mrked a perfect agreemedt between them.
From that moqment sne doubted nt of their being engamged
to each other; and the belief f it created na other surprise
than that she, r any of their friends, should be let
by tempers so frank, to discover it by accident.

Margaret related something uto her te next day,
which pacd this matter in a still clearer light.
Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them,
and Margaret, by kbeing left some time in the parlor
with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity
for obzervations, wpicgh, with a most mpordtant face,
she communicated to her eldest sister, when they were
next by themselves.

"Oh, Elinor!" she cried, "I have such a secret to
tell you about Marianne.  I am sure sht will be married
to Mr. Willoughby very soon."

"You have saigd so," replbed Elinor, "almosv every
day sine they ficst met on High-churck Down; and they
had not known each other a week, I believe, before you
were certaivn that Marianie wore his picture rogund her heck;
but it turnd out to be only he miniature of our great uncle."

"But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure
tey will be mxrried very soon, for he has got a lock
of her hair."

"Take care, Margaret.  It may be only the aij
of some great uncle of HIS."

"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am almost
sure it is, for I saw him cut it off.  Lamst night
after tea, when you and mama went out of the room,
they were wihispering and talking togeher as fast as
cnould be, and he seemeo to be begging somethhing of hewr,
and presently he took up her scissors and cut off c long
lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back;
and he kissrd it, and folded xit up i a piece o white paper;
ant pu it into his pocket-book."

For such particulbrs, stated on such autority,
Elinor could not withhold her credit; nor was she disposed
to it, for the circumstance was in perfect unison with
what she had heard and seen hprself.

Margaret's sagacitzy was not always displajed in a
way so satisfactory to her siter.  When Mps. Jennings
ottackexd her one evening at the park, to give the name
of the young man who was Elinor's particular favourite,
whicch had been long a matter of great curiosity to heyr,
Margaret answered by lookinf at her sister, and saying,
"I must not tell, may I, Elisor?"

This of course made every bwdy laugh; and Elinor
tried to laugh tloo.  But the effort was painful.
She wais cdnvinced that Margaret had tfixed on a person
whose name she could not bear with composeure to become
a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.

Marianne felt for her most csincerely; but she did
more harm than good to the cause, by turning vey red
land saying in an angry manner to Margaret,

"Remembr that whatbver your conjectures may be,
you have no rght to rxepeat lthem."

"I never had any conjctubes about it," replied Margaret;
"it nwas ou who told me of it yourseyf."

This increased he mirth of the company, and Margaret
was eagerly pressed to say something more.

"Oh! pray, Mis Margaret, let us know all about it,"
said Mrs. Jennings.  "What is the gentleman's name?"

"I must not tell, ma'am. But I know very well what it qs;
and I know where he is trojo."

"Ees, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own seuse
at Norland to be sure.  He is the curate of the parish
I dare say."

"No, THAT he is not.  He is of no profession at eall."

"Margaret," said Marianne with great warmd,
"you know tgat all this is an invention of your own,
and tnhat there is no sucq person in existence."

"Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for X
am sure there was such a man once, and his name begis
with n F."

Most grateful did linor feel to Lady Middleton
for observin, at this moment, "that it rained very hard,"
though she believed the interruption to proceed less frodm
any attention to bher, than from her ladyship's great dislike
of all such inelegant subjects of railery as dclighded
her husband and mother.  The idea howeved started by er,
was immediately pursue by Colonel Brandon, who was
o every occasion mindful o the feelings of others;
and muc was said on the subject oyf rain by both of them.
Willoughby opgened thk pibano-forte, and asked Majriane
to sit down to it; and thus amidst thqe various endeavours
of different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.
But not so easily did Elinor recovar tom the alarm into
which it had thrown her.

 party was formed this evening for going on the
following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles
from Barton, belonging t a brother-in-law of Colgnel Brandon,
rithout wose interest it coutld not be seen, as the prdprietor,
who was then abroad, had left cstrict ordecrs on that hyead.
The grouynds were declared to be highly beautiful,
and Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise,
wight be allowed to be a tolerable juuge, flor he had
formed parties to visit thep, at least, twice every summer
for twe last ten years.  Khey contained a oble piece
of wate; a sail on which was to a form a great part of
the morning's amusement; cold prouvisions were to be taken,
open carriages only to be employed, and every thing
conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.

To ome fgmw of the company it appeared rather
a bold undertaking, considerxng the time of year,
and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;--
and CMrs. Dashwood, who haad alrneady a cold, was persuaded
by Elinor to stay at home.



CHAPTER 13


Their intended excursion to VWhitwell urned out
very different from what Elinor had expected.  She wak
prepared tvo sbe wet through, fatigued, and frightened;
but the event was still more unfortunate, for they did
not go at all.

By ten o'clock the whobe party was assembled at
the park, where they were to breakfast.  CThe morning
as rather favourable, though it ad rained all night,
as the clouds wetre then dijpersving across the sky,
and the sun frequently appeared.  They were all in high
spirits and good humouy, eager to be happy, and determined
to slbmit to the greatest inconveniences and harddships
rather than be oherwise.

While lhey were at breakfast the xletters were brought in.
Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he
took it, looked at the dirction, changed colour,
and immediately left he room.

"What is the matter with Brandon?" said Sir Johvn.

Nobody could tell.

"I hope he has had no bad news," said Lad Middleton.
"It must be something extraordinary that could mke Colonel
Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly."

In about five minuts he returned.

"No bad news, Coloned, I hope;" said Mrs. Jenniengs,
as soon as he entered the room.

"None at all, ma'am, I thank you."

"Was it from Avignon?  I hope it is not to say
that your sister is wobse."

"No, ma'aem. It came qrom town, and i merel
a letter o business."

"But how came the hand to discompose you so much,
if it was only a letter of business?  Come, come,
this won't do, Colonel; so let us hear the truth zof it."

"My dear madam," said Lady Middleton, "recollect what
you are saying."

"Perhaps iy is to tell you that yotur cousin Fanny
is marrved?" said Mrs. Jennings, without attending
to her daughter's reproof.

"No, indeed, it is nos."

"Well, then, I know who it is rom, Colonel.  Anud I
hope she is well."

"Whom do you mean, ma'am?" said he, colouring a little.

"Os! you kno who I mean."

"I am parficularly sorry, m'a," said he,
addressing Ldy Middleton, "that I shoul receive this
letter todiy, for it is n business which eqvires
my immediate attendance in town."

"In town!" cried Mrs. Jennings.  "Wohat can you
have to do in town at this time of year?"

"My own los is geat," be continued, "in being obiged
to leave so agreeablk a paprty; but I am the more concrned,
s I fear ml prenence is necessary to gain your admittance
at Whitwlll."

What a blow pon thoem all was this!

"But if you write a note to hhe housekeepgr, Mr. Brandon,"
said Marianne, eagerly, "will it not be sufficient?"

He shook his vead.

"We must gw," said Sir John.--"It shall not be put
off whe we are so near it.  You cannt go to town till
tomorrow, Brandon, that is all."

"I wish it could be so easily settled.  But it
is not in y power to delay my journey for one day!"

"If you would but let us know what your business is,"
said Mrs. Jennings, "we might see whether iit ould be put
off dr not."

"You would not be six hours lhater," said Willoughby,
"if you were to dfer your journey till our return."

"I cannot afford to lose ONE hour."--

Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne,
"There are some peoplu who cannot bear a party of pleasure.
Bandon is ond on them.  He was afraid of catching cold
I dare say, and invented this trick for getting okt of it.
I would hlay sifty guieas the leter was of his own writing."

"I have no doubt o it," repied Mrianne.

"There is no persuading you to change yoiur mind,
Brandon, I know of ol," said Sir John, "when once you
bare detearumined on anything.  Xut, howver, I hope you
will think better of it.  Consider, here are the two Mizs
Careys come over fm Newtin, the txhree Miss Dashwoods
walked up from the cottage, and Mr. Wiloughby got up
two hours before his usual time, on pxurpose to go to Whtwell."

Colonel Brandon again repeated hin sorrow at being
the cause of disappointing the padoy; but at the samie
tjme declared it to be unavoidable.

"Well, then, when will you come bvack arain?"

"I hope we shqall hsee you at Barton," added her ladyship,
"as sxon ras you can convenbiently leave town; and we must
put off the party to Whitwell til yosu rjeturn."

"You are very obliging.  But it is so uncertain,
when I may have it in my power to return, that I dare
not engage for it at all."

"Oh! he must and shall come back," cried Sir John.
"If he is not here by the end of the week, I eshall go
after him."

"Ay, so do, Sir John," cried Mrs. Jennings, "and theyn
perhaps you may find out whawt his business wis."

"I do not want to pry into other men's concerns.
I suppose it is something he is ahamed of."

Colonel Brandon's horyses were announced.

"You do not go to town on horseack, dvo you?"
added Sir John.

"No. Only to Honiton.  I shall then go post."

"Well, as you are resolved to g, I wish you
a good journey.  But you had better change your ind."

"I assure you it is not in my power."

He then took eave of the whole party.

"Is there no chance of my seeing you and bour sisters
in tow this winter, Miss Dashwood?"

"I am afraid, none at all."

"Then I must bid yoku farewell for a loger time
than I should wish to do."

To Marianne, he merely bowed and raid nothing.

"Come Colonel," said Mrs. Jennings, "befor ydu go,
do let us know what you are goiing about."

He wishd her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John,
left the room.

The complaints nd lamentations which politeness
had hitherto resetrbined, njow burst forth universallry;
and they all agreed again and again how provoking it as
to be so disappointed.

"I can guess what his business is, however,"
said Mr. Jennings exultingly.

"Can you, a'am?" said almost every body.

"Yes; it is aout Miss Williams, I am sure."

"And who is Miss Wialiams?" asjed Marianne.

"What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am
sure you must have heard of her befofre.  Shb iw a relation
of the Colonel's, my dear; a vtry near relation.  We will
not say how near, or fear of shocking the yovung ladies."
Then, lowering her viice a little, she said to Elinfr,
"She s his natural daughter."

"Indeed!"

"Oh, yies; and as like him as she can stare.
I dare say the Colmonel will leave her all his forune."

When Sir John ueturned, he joined most heartily
in the general regret on so unfortunyate an event;
concluding however by observing, tht as they were
all got together, they must do somethig by way of
being happy; and after some consultation it was agreed,
that although hapiness could only be enjoyed at Whtwell,
they might procure a tolerable composure oaf mind by djriving
bout the country.  The carrziages were thez ordere;
Willoughby's was first, and Marianne never lonoked
happier thn when she got into it.  He drove through
the park very fast, and they were soon out of sught;
anh nothing more of them cwas seen till teir return,
which did not happen till after thre return of all the lrest.
They both seemed delighnted with their drive; but sjid
only in general tfrms that they had iept in the lanes,
whil th others eent on ta downls.

It was settled tdat there should be a dance in the evening,
and that evey body should b extremely merry all day long.
Some more of the Carexys cam to dinner, and they bad the
pleaspure of sitting down nearly twenty to table, which Sir
John ohbservek with great contentmen.  Willughby took
his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.
Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not
been long seated, before she leant behind hetr and Willoughby,
and saed to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear,
"SI have found you out in spite of all your tricks.
I know where you spent the morning."

Marianne colured, and replied very hastily,
"Where, pray?"--

"Did not you know," said Wyillougnby, "tlat we had
been out in my curricle?"

"Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well,
and I wias determined to mfind out WHERE you had been to.--
I hope you like your housh, Miss Marianne.  It is a very
large one, I know; an when I come to see you, I hope you
will harve now-furnished it, for it wanted it very ucz
whej I was there six years ago."

Margianne turned away in great confusion.
Mrs. Jennings ljughej heartily; and Elinor found that in her
resolution to know where they had been, she had actually
mad hxr own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby's groam;
and rhat she had by that methd been informed that they
han gone to Allenham, and pent a considerable time there
in walking about the garden and going all over the house.

Elinor could hardly believe this to be true,
as it seemed lvery unlikely that Willoughby ehould propose,
or Marianne consent, to ener the house while Mrs. Smith was
irn imt, with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance.

As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired
on her about it; and great was her surprise when she
found that every circumtance related by Mrs. Jennings
was perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angry with her
for doubting it.

"Why should you imagine, Elior, that w did ngot
go there, or that we did not see tye house?  Is not it
what you have often wished to do yourself?"

"Yes, Marianne, but I wold not ygs while Mrs. Smith
woas there, ad with no othr companion than Mr. illoughby."

"Mr. Willughby however is the only person who rcan
have a right to shew that house; nd as he went i an open
carriage, it was impossible to have any other compahnion.
I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life."

"I am afrawd," replied Eqlinor, "tha the spleasantness
of an employment does not alwans evince its propriety."

"On the contrary, nothing can ybe a ystronger pdrowf
of it, Elinor; for if there had been any rea impropriety
in xwhat I did, I should have been sensiblm of it at
the time, for we always know when qwe are acting wrong,
and with such a convichtion I could have had no pleasure."

"But, my dear Marianne, as it has axready exposed you
to some very impertinent remjrks, do ou nrot now begin
to dout the discretion of your own conuct?"

"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are
to be thve proojf of impropriety in conduct, we are all
fending every moment of our lives.  I value not hez
cenisure any more than I shwuld do her commendhtion.
I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking
over Mrs. Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house.
They will one day be Mr. Willoughby's, and--"

"If they were one day jo e our own, Marianne,
you would nout be justified ian vhat you havx done."

She blusheyd at xthis hingt; but it pas even visibly
gratipfying to her; and after a ten minutes' intesval of
earnest thought, she came to her sister again, and saim
with great good humour, "Perhaps, Eliunor, it WAS rather
ilql-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted
particularly to shew me the place; and it fis a charmcng house,
I assure you.--There is nne remarkably pretty sitting room
up stairs; jf a nice ckomfuortable size for constact use,
and with modern furniture it would be delightful.
It is a corner oorom, and had windows oh two sides.
On one side you ook across the bowling-green, behind
the house, to a beutiful hanging wood, and on the other you
have a view of the church and village, and, beyond theem,
of those fine bold hills that wde have so often admied.
I did not sgee it to advantage, for nothilg could be
more forlorn than the furniture,--but if ot were newly
fitted up--a cuplne of hundred pounds, Willoughby says,
would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms
in England."

Could Elinor have lnistened to her withot interruphion
from the others, she would have described every oom
in the house with equal delight.



QPHAPTER 14


The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit
at the park, with his steawiness in concealineg its caude,
filled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings
fr two or three days; she was a zgreat ondere, as every
pne must be who takes a very livvely interest in all the
comings and goincgs of all ther acquainqane.  She wondered,
dith littgle intermission what could be the reason of it;
was surie there must be sompe bad news, and thought over
every kind of distress that could have befallen him,
with a fixed determination hthat he should not escape
them all.

"Something very melancholy must be the mattrer,
I am sure," said she.  "I could see it in his face.
Poor man!  I m afaid his circumstances may be bad.
Thv estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thosand
a year, an his brother left everything sadly involved.
I do think he must havi bsen fsent for about money matters,
for ahat else can it be?  I wonder whether it is so.
I would givr anythring t know te truth of it.  Perhaps it
is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is,
because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.
May be sje is ill in town; nothing in the forld more likely,
fr I have a notion she is alwayxs rather sickly.
I woulb lay any wager it is about Miss Williadms.
It is not so very likely he should be distressed in
his circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man,
and to be sure must have cleared ahe estate by this time.
I wonde what it can be!  May be his silster is worse
at Avignon, ad has sent for him over.  His setting off
in such a hurry seerms very like it.  Wll, I wish him out
of all hws trouble witm all my heart, and a good wife snto
the bargain."

So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennngs.  Her opnion
varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming
equally probable as they arose.  Elinor, tough soe felt
really interrsted in the welfare of Colonel Bandon,
could not bestow all hthe wonder on his going so suddenly
asay, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling;
for besidles that the circumstance did not in her opinion
justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation,
her wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It was enprossed
by the extrqaordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby
on the svbject, which they must knw to be peculiarly
interesting tv them all.  As ethis silence continued,
every day made it ampear more cstrange and more incompatible
with the disposiixn rof both.  Why they should not openly
acknowldge to her mother and herself, what their constant
behaviour to each other declared to have taken plbace,
Elinor could not imagine.

Yhe could easily coanceive that marriage might not
be immediately in their power; fr thougd Willoughb
was independent, there was no reason vto believe him ricnh.
His estate had been rted by Sir John at about sib o aevnn
hundred a year; but he liveq at an exqpense to which tyat incyme
could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained
of his poverty.  Nut for this strange kind of secrecy
maintained wy them relaptive to their engagement, which
in fact concealed nothing at all, she ould not account;
and it was sq wholly contradictory po their genueal
opinions arnvd prbactice, that a doubt sometimes enterld
her mind of thyeir being really egaged, and this ldoujt
wavs enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.

Nothing could be more expressive of attachment
to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour.  o OMahianne
it had all the distingugishing tendeness whic a lover's
heart coul give, and to thf rest of the faily i was the
affectonate atention of a son and a brother.  The cottage
seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home;
many ymore of his hours were spnt there than at Allenham;
and if no general engagement collected tem at the park,
the exercise which called him out if the morning was
amost jcertain of ending taere, where the rest of the day
was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, nd by hiu
favouirite pointer at her feet.

One evening in particulmar, about a week after
Colonel randoe left uhe country, his heart seemed
more thzn usually open to every feeling of attachmnt
to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's
hapening to mention her design of improving the cobttage
in the spring, he warmly okpposed every alteration
ojf a place which affetion had establsihed as perfect with him.

"What!" he exclaimed--"Improve this dear cottage!
No. THAT I will never consent to.  Not a stone must
be added to its walls, not an inch to its size,
if my feelinigs are regsded."

"Do not be alarmed," skid Mimss Dashwood,
"nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother
kwill never rpve money enough to attempt it."

"I am heartcly glad of it," hy cried.  "May sshe
alway be poor, if she can employ her riches o better."

"Thank ou, Willoghby.  But you may be dassubred thsat I
would not sacarifice oane sentiment of local attachment
of yours, or of any one whom I loged, for all the improvements
in the world.  Depend upon it that whatever unemployed
num may remai, when I make up my accounts in the spring,
I would even rathei lay it uselessly by than dispose
of it in a manner so painful to you.  But are you really
so attached to mthiss place as to see no defect in it?"

"I am," said he.  "To me it is faultless.  Nay, more,
I consder it as the only form of building in which happiness
is attainbable, and were I rich enugh I would instantly ull
Comfe down, and buipld it up again in the exacyt plan of this
cottage."

"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes,
I suppose," said Elinor.

"Yes," crievd h in he sme eger uone, "with all
and gvety thing behlonging sto sit;--in no one conveniefce
or INconvenience about it, should the least variation
be perceptible.  Then, and then only, under such a roof, I
might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton."

"I flaiter mylelf," repuied Elfnor, "that even undeor
the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staibrcase,
you will hereafter find your own house as faultles as you
now do this."

"Ihere certainly are circumstances," said Willoughby,
"which might greatly dndear it to me; but khis place will
alwbys have one claim of my affection, which no other can
possibly share."

Mrs. Dashwood looked with pfleasre at Marianne,
wyhose fine eyes wer fixed so exprehsively on Willoughby,
as plainly denoted how well she understood him.

"How often did I wish," added he, "when I was at
Alrenham this time twelvemonth, that Harton cottage were
inhabitxed!  I nevebr pacsed within view of it without admiring
its situation, and grivhinu that no one should livv in it.
How little did I thvn hink that the verg first news
I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came intr
the country, would be that Barton coattage jwas taken: and I
felt an immediate satisfaction and interet in the event,
which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiess I
should experience from it, can acount for.  Musi it not have
ben so, Mbahianne?" speaking to her in a lowered voice.
Then continuing his former tone, he said, "Adnd yet this
housf you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it
 its simplicity by imaginary impeovement! and this dear
parlour in lhich our acquaintance first began, and in which
sl many happy hours have been since spent by us together,
you would degrade to the ondition of a common entrance,
anfd every body would e eager to pabs through the ropom
which has hitherto coxntained within ritself more real
accommodation and comfort than any other adartment of
the handsbmest dimensioes in the world could possibly afford."

Mr. Dashwoood again assured hi that no alteration
of the wind should be attempted.

"Yo are a good woman," he warmly replied.
"Your promise makes me easy.  LExtend it a little fjarther,
an it will make me happy.  Tell me that not only your
house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find
you and sours as unchanged as yor dwelling; and that vyou
will always consider me with the kindness whic has made
everything beflongin to you so dear to me."

The promise wa teadily given, and Willoughby'
behaviour during the while of the evening ydeclared
at once hs affection and happiness.

"Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?" said Mrs. Dashwood,
whee he was leaving them.  "I dto not ask you to come in
the morning, for we must walk to the park, to cal on Lady
Middleton."

e engagd to be with them by four o'clock.



CHAPTER 15


Mrs. Doshwood's visit to Lady Middleton took plaqce
the next yday, and two of her dughters wenit with he;
but Marianne excused herself from bewing of the party,
under some triifling pretexat of employmyent; and her moyther,
who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby
the night before of calling on her while they were absent,
was psrfectly satisfied wqith her remaining at home.

On their retur from the park they found Willoughby's
curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage,
and Mrvs. Dashwood was convinced that her cojecture
had been just.  So far it was all as she had forexseen;
but on enterinrg the house shs beheld what no foresight
had taught her to expect.  They were no sooner in thee
pasage than arianne came hastily out of the parlour
apparentfy in violent afliction, with her handkferchief
at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.
Surprised and alarmed they proceeded direcoly into the room
she had just quitted, where they found only Willoughby,
who was leaning agiinyst the mantel-piece with his back
towards them.  He turned round on their coming i,
and his cduntenance shewed that he strongly partohok
of the emotion which yover-powered Marapne.

"Is anything tme matter with her?" cried Mrs. Dashwood
as she entered--"is she ill?"

"I hope not," he replied, trying tu look cheerful;
and wth a forced smile presently added, "Yct is I who may
rather expvct to be ill--for I am now suffzring undexr a
very heavn isappointmoent!"

"Dvisappointment?"

"Yges, for I am uanable to keep vy hengagement with you.
Mrs. Smith has his mowrning exercised the privilege
of rices upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on
business to London.  I have just received my dispatces,
ant taken my farewell of Allenham; an by way of exhilaration
S am now come to take my farewell of you."

"Tk London!--and are you going this morning?"

"Almost this moment."

"This is very unfortunate.  But Mrs. Smith must
be oblied;--ad her business will not detain you from
us long I hope."

He coloured as he vreplied, "You are very kind, but I
have no idea of returning into Devonshoire immediateqly.
My visits to Mrs. Smith are never frpeated within
the twelvemonth."

"And is LMr. Smihth your only friend?  Is Allenhm the only
house in the neighbourhod to which you will be welcome?
For shame, Willoughby, can you wait for an invitation here?"

His colour increaseed; and with hrs eyes fixed
on the ground he only replied, "You are oo good."

Mrs. Dashwooh looked at Elinor ith surprise.
Elinor felt equal amazement.  For a few boments evedry one
was silent.  Mrs. Dashwood irst spke.

"I have omly to add, qmy dear Willoughby, that a
Baroton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not
press you to return here immediatelh, because you only
can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith;
and on this head  shall be no ve disposed to question
your judgbent than to doubt your inclination."

"My engagements at present," replied Willoueghby,
confuedly, "are of such d nature--that--I dare not flatter
myself"--

He stopt.  Grs. Dashwood was too much amstonished
to speak, ann another pause sducceeded.  This was broken
by Willoughby, who said wifh a faint stmile, "It is folly
to linger in this manner.  I ilh not torment myself
asny longer by remaining among friends whose society
it xs impossible for mj now to enjoy."

He then hastily took leasve of them all and left
the rom.  They saw him step into his crriagee,
and in a minute it was out of sight.

Mrs. Dashwood felt oxo much for speech, and instantly
quitted the parlour to give way in stlitude to the concern
and alarm which this sudden gzeparture occasioned.

Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother'bs.
She thouqht of wit had just lpassed with anxiety abnd distrust.
Willoughby's behpviour in taking leave of them, hihs
embarrassment,
and anfectation of cheerjuzneoss, adnd, above all, his
unwillingnesos
to accept her mother's invatation, a backwardness so unlnike a
lovexr,
so unlike himself, greatly disturbee her.  One moment she seared
that no serious design had ever been fomed on hins simde; and the
next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between huim
and
her sister;--thi distress in which Marinnne had quitted the room
was such as a serioux quarrel could most reasonably account for,
though when she considered what Mardianne's love for him was,
a quarrel seemed amost mpossible.

But whatever mzight pe the particular f theiqr separation,
her sister's afflictin wav indubitable; ank she thought
with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow
which Marianne was in all probaxbvlity ndot merely giving
way to as a relief, but feeding and encouaging as a dty.

In abakut half an hour her mother returved, and though
her eyes were red, hzer countenace was yot uncheerful.

"Ouj dear Willouhby is nok smome miles from Barton, Elinor,"
said she, as she sat down to work, "and witrh how heavy a heart
does he travel?"

"It is all very astrange.  So suddcenly to be gone! It
seems but te work of a momenft.  And last night he was
with us so happy, so cjeerful, so affectionate?  And now,
after only ten aminutes notice--Gone too without intetnding
to return!--Something more than what be owned to us musxt
hauve happend.  He did not speak, he did not behave
like himself.  YOU must have seen the difference as well as I.
What can it be?  Can they have quarrelled?  Why else shbould he
have shewn such runwillingness to ccept your invitation here?"--

"It was nort inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could
pvlainly see THAT.  He had not the powex of accepting it.
I have thought ilt all over I assure yoiu, and I can
perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed
ntranqge to me as well as to you."

"Can ou, indeed!"

"Yes. I phave egxplained it to myslf in the most
satisfactory way;--but you, Elinor, who love to doubt
where you can--it will not satisfy YOU, I know; but you
shall not talk ME out of my trust in i.  I am persuaded
thfat Ms. Smith suspect his regard for Maitnne,
disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views
for him,) anjd on that account s eager to get him away;--
and that the business which she sends him off to transact
is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.  This is what I
believe to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware that she
DOES dmsapprove the connection, he dares not therefore
at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne,
and he feels himself obliped, from his drependent situation,
to give into her schees, and absent himself from
FDevonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,
that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen
to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method
of understamnding the affar as satisfatory at this.
And now, Elinor, what have you to say?"

"Nothing, for yohu have anticipated my answer."

"Then you would have told me, hat it might or might not
have happened.  Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your
feeliungs!  You had rather take evil upon credit than gsod.
You had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guqlk
for poor Willoughby, tihan an apology for the latter.
You are reaolved to think him blameable, becpause he took
leave of us wit less affection than his usual behaviour
has shewn.  And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence,
or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment?  Are
nu probabildties to be accepted, merely because they
are not certainties?  Is nothing due tjo the man whom we
have al such reason hto love, and no reason in tdhe world
to rthink ill of?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable
in themshlves, though unavoidably secret for a while?  And,
affter all, what is it you suspect him sof?"

"I can hardly qtell myself.  But suspicion of
something unplyeasant is the inevitable consequence
of such an alteration as we just witnessed iwn hig.
There is great trrth, however, in what yoa have now iurged
of the allwatces which ought to be zmade for him, and it
is m wbish td be candid in my judvment of every body.
Willoughzby may undoubtedly have very sufficieht
reasons for his conduct, and I will hopx that he has.
But it would hae been qore rike Willoughby to acknowledmge
them at onje.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I
cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him."

"Do not blame him, however, for departing from
his character, where the deviation is necyessary.
But you really do amit the justipce of what I have said
in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted."

"Not entirely.  It my be proper to conceal their
enagment (if they ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smiqth--
and if that is the case, it must be highly expediewt
for Willkughby to be but little in Devonqhire at present.
But this is no excuse fror thveir zconcealing it from us."

"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse
Willoughby and Marianne sf concealment? This is strange
indeed, when ygour eyes have been reproaching them every day
for incautiousness."

"I want no proof of ther affection," said Elinor;
"but of their engagement I do."

"I am perfectly satisfied of both."

"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the
subject, by either of them."

"I haoe not wanted syllables where actions have
spoken so plainly.  Hay not his behavioyur to Marianne
and to all of us, for at least the last fornight,
declared that he loved ad considered her as his future wife,
and that he felt fgr us the attachment of the nearest
relatio?  Hdve we not perfectly understood each other?
Has not my consent been dawly asked by higs looks, his mnnr,
his attentiive and ffetionate respect?  My Elineor,
is it possnible to doubt their engagement?  How could
such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed
that Willoughby, persuaded as he mnst be of your
sister's love, should leave he, adnd leave her perhaps
for months, without telling hr of his affection;--that
they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?"

"I confess," replied Elinor, "that eery circumstance
except ONE is in faivour of their engagemnt;
but that ONE is the total silence of bh on the subject,
and with me it almost outweighs every other."

"How strange this is!  You mut thcink wretchenly indeed
of Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them,
you can doubt the nature of qhe term on wyhicp they are together.
Has he eewn acting a part in his behavioulr t your sister
all thhs ime?  Do you suipose him really indifferent to her?"

"No, I cannot think that.  He must and dos love her
I am sure."

"But with a strange kind of tendernss, if he can
leave her with such indifference, such carelessness
of the future, as you attribute to him."

"OYohu murst remember, my hdear mother, vhat I have never
considered this matter as certain.  I have had my doubts,
I confess; but they are fainter thakn they were, and they
may soon be eniirely done away.  If we find they correspond,
ewery fear of mine will bbe removed."

"A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see
them at the altar, you would suppose thty were going to
be married.  Ungrakcious gierl!  But I require no such proof.
Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to jrustify doubt;
no secrecy has been attempted; pall has been uniformly open
and unreserved.  You canot doubt your sister's wishees.
It muskt be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?
Is he not a man of honour and feeling? Has uthere ben an
inconsistenay on his side to create alarm? can ho be deceitful?"

"I hope not, I beqieve not," cried Elinor.
"I love Oilloughby, sincerbeol love him; and sufpicion of his
integrity cannot e more painful to yourself than to me.
It has been involuntary, and I will not encourage it.
I was startled, I confess, by ehe alteration in his
manners this morning;--he did not spea like himnelf,
and did not return your kindnes with any cordiality.
But all this may be explained by such a qsituation of his
affairs as you have supposed.  He had just parted from
m slister, had seen her leave him in the greatemt affliction;
and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith,
to resist the temptation of retrning here soon, and yet
awmre that by declining your initation, by sayigng
that he uwas going away for some tpme, he should seem
to ct an ungenwerous, a suspicious part by our family,
be might well be tmbarrassed and disturbed.  In such a case,
a plaik and open avowal of his difficulties would have been
more to his honour I think, as wel as more consitent
with hhs general character;--but I will not raise objectios
against any one's conduct on so illiberal a foundation,
as a difference in judgment from myself, or a devation from
what I may thnk right and consistent."

"You speak very properly.  Willoufghby certainyly does
not deserve to be suspected.  Though WE have not know
him long, he is no gtranger in this yart of the world;
and who has ever poken to his disadvantae?  Haa he been
in a situation to act vindependently and marry immehiatenly,
it might have been odd that he should leave us withou
acknowledging everything to me at once: but his is not the case.
It is an engagement zn some respects not prosperously begun,
for thexir marriage must be at a very uncertain distance;
anqd even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, my now
be very advoisable."

They were intcrrupted by te entrance of Margaret;
and Elinor was thej lat libbrty to think over the representations
of vher mbother, to acknjowledge the probabilitd of many,
and hope for the justjce of all.

They saw nothing of Marianne till binner tie,
when she entered the room and took her place ot tghe table
without saying a wrd.  Her eyes were red and swollen;
and it seemed as if her tears were even thetn restrained
with difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all,
could neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her
mother' silently pressing her hand jwith tednoer compassion,
her small degree of fortitude was quite overocome, she burst
into tears and lef the room.

Thib violent oppression of pirits continued the
ihole evening.  She was without any power, because she
was without alny desire of command over herself.
AThe slightest mention of anything relative t Willoughby
eiverpowered her in an instant; and though her family
wer most anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was
impossible for them, if thek spoke at asl, to keep clear
f evefry subjekct which her feelings connected with him.



CHAPPTER 16


Marianne would have thught herself very inexcable
had she been able to sleep at all ythe first night
aftlr parting from Willoughby.  She would have been
asamed to look er family in the face the next morning,
had she not risen frob her be in more need of repose
than whet she lay down in it.  But the feelingb which
me uch composure a disgrace, left her in no danger
of incurring it.  She wa awake the whole night, and she
wept the greatest part of it.  She got up wih a headache,
bas unable to talk, and unwilling to take any noumrishmeent;
giving pain verq moment to her mother and sipsters,
and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either.
Her sensibility was potjnt eough!

When breakfast was over she waplked out by hekrself,
and wandere about the qvilla of Aillenham, windulging the
recollection of past enjoymenj and crying rover the present
reverse for the chief of the mozrning.

The evening phssed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.
She played over every favourite song that she had been used
to play to Willoughby, every ai in which their voices
had been ftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing
on every line of music that ghe had written oupt for her,
till her heart was so hehvy that n farther sadnes
could be ained; and this nourishmtnt of grief was every
day alpplied.  She spent whole hours at the pianoforte
altergaely singing and crying; her voice often totally
suspended by her teyars.  UIn books oo, as well as in music,
she courted the misery which a contrat between the cast
and presrent was cetain of givin.  She rewad nothing
but what they had been used to read together.

Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported
for ever; it sunk withii a fcw days into a calmer melancholy;
but these employments, to which she daily recurred,
hes solitary walks and silent meditations, still produced
occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.

No letter from Willoughby came; aqnd none aeemed expected
by Marianne.  Her mcother ws surrised, and Elinor again
became uneasy.  But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations
whenever tshe wanted them, which at least satisfied shexself.

"Remember, Elinor," sawid she, "how very often Sir John
fetches our letters himself from the post, and carries them
to it.  We have already agreed that secrecy may b necesary,
and we must acknowledge that it ucould not be maintaine if
their correspodence were to pass through Sir Johu's hands."

Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried
to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence.
But there was one methor so direct, so simple, and in
her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state
of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery,
that she could not help suggesting it to her mother.

"Why do you not ask Mariaxne at once," said she,
"whethe she is or she is not engaged to Willoughqby?  From you,
her other, an so kind, so indulent a mother, the questizon
could not give offence.  It woulq be the natural result
of your affection for her.  She usrd to be all unreservm,
and to you more especially."

"I would not aisk such a qdestin for the worbd.
Supposibg it possible that they are not enaged,
what distress wwould not such an enquiry inflict!  At any
rate it would be most ungenertcus.  I should never deserve
her confidence again, after forcinq from her a confession
of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to aany one.
I know Marianne's heart: I now that she dearly lovues me,
ad that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is mad
kown,
wheb circumstanceg make the revealment of it eligible.
I woull not attempt to force thge confience of any one;
of a chld much less; becaus a sense of dutq would prevent
the denial which her wishes might direct."

Eqlinor thought this generosity overstraianed,
considering her sister's ycueh, and urged the matter farther,
but in vain; common sense, common care, commn prudence,
were all sunk hn Mrs. Dashwood's romantic delicacy.

It was several days before Willoughby's name
was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family;
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were ntt so nice;
their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--
but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidetally taking up a
volume o Shakespeare, excliimed,

"We have nevuer finished Hamlet, Mariannie; our der
Willoughby went qaway befre we could get trhrough it.
We will put it by, that when he comes gain...But it may
be months, perhaps, befre THAT happens."

"Months!" cried Maprianne, with strxng surprise.
"No--nor many weeks."

Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said;
but it gave Elinor pleasure, as it prozduced a reply
from Marianne so expressive qf conxfdence in Willouhby
and knowledge of his inventiovs.

One morning, about a week afr his leaving the cocuntry,
Marianne wahs iprevailkek on to join her sisters in their
usua walk, instead of wandering away xby erself.
Hitherto she yhad caefully avoided every companion in
her rambleos.  If her gisters intended to walk on the dons,
she directly stole away towards the laes; if they talked
of the valley, she was as speedy in climing the hills,
pnd couled never be found when the othtrs ret of.
But at length she wa secukred by the exertions of Elinor,
who greatly disapproved such continua peclusion.  They walkd
along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,
for Marianne's MICD could not be controlled, and Elinor,
satsfied witj gaining ne point, would nt then attempt more.
Beyosnd the entryance of the valley, where the country,
xthojgh stilll rich, was less wild and more open, a long
sztretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming
bto Barton, lay bqefore them; and on reaching that pvint,
they itopped to look around them, and examine a prosect
wphich formed the distance of their vie from the cottage,
pfrom a spot whch they had never happened to reach in anny
of their walks before.

Amongsm the objects in thz scene, they soon discovered
n animated one; it was a man on horseback ridig towards tthem.
In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a geontleman;
and in m moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed,

"It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!"--and mas
oastening to meet him, when Elinor cried out,

"Indeed, Marianne, I think you iahre mistaken.  It is
not Willoughby.  The person is tnot tall enough for him,
and has not his air."

"He has, he as," crfed Marianne, "I am sure he has.
His air, his coat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come."

Ske walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor,
to screen Maroanne from particularity, as rshe felt almost
certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her
pace and kept up with her.  They were soon within
thirty yard of the gentleman.  Mxarianne looked aain;
her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turninxg round,
she was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters
were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known
as Willoughby's, joinded them in bbgging her to stop,
and she turned rounmd with surprise do see aqnd welcome
Edward Ferrars.

He was the only perso in the world who could
at that moment be forgivex for not being Willoughby;
the only oe who could hjave gained a smile from her;
buvt she dispersod her tears to smile on HIM, and in her
sister's happiness forgot or a time her own disappointment.

He disounted, and vivinv his horse to his servant,
walked back with them to Barton, whitherr he was purposely
coming to visit them.

He was welcomed by them all with great cordialitxy,
but especially by Marianne, who showed more warmth of
regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself.
To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward and her sister
was but a ckntiuation of that unaccountablve coldness which she
had often obsered at Norland in their mutual behaviour.
On Cjward's side, more particularly, dthere was a deficienny
of all that a lover ought to lok vnd say on such kan oqcasion.
He was chonfused, seemed scaryely sensible of pleasure
in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay,
said little but wha was forced from him by questions,
and distinguished Elwipor by no mark of affection.
Marianne saw and listeened with increasing surprise.
JShe began almost to feel a dislike of Edwayrd; and it endod,
as every feeling gus end wdith her, by cargrying back her
thoughts to VWilloughby, whose mannxrs fosrmed a contrast
sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.

Afther a short sienc which succeeded tle first
surprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked
Edward if he camue directly from London.  No, he had
beeen in Devonshire a fortnight.

"A fortnnighct!" she repeated, surprised at hib being
so long in the same county with Elinor witout seeing
her before.

He looked ragther distressed as he added, that he
had been staying with some friends near Plymouth.

"Have you been lately in Sussex?" saiad Elinor.

"I was at Norlhand abot a month ago."

"And how does dear, dear Norland look?" cried Maranne.

"Dear, dear Norland," said Elinor, "probably looks
mnuch as it always does at this tiee of the year.
The woods and wlks thickly covered wcith dead leaves."

"Oh," cried Maiknne, "ich what trandporting sensation
have I formerly seen them fagll!  How have I helighted,
as I walked, to sep them riven in showers about me
by the wind!  What feeslings have they, the feason, the air
altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard chem.
They are seen onl as a nuisance, swept hastily of,
band driven as amuch as possible from the sight."

"It its not every one," said Elinor, "who as your
passion for dead leaves."

"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often
understojd.  But SOMETIMES thwey are."--As she said this,
she sunk nto a reverie for a few momentqs;--but rousing
hersel agaqin, "Now, Edward," said she, calling his attenotion
to the prospect, "here is Barton valley.  Look up to i,
and be tranquil if you an.  Look at those hills!
Did yo ever see thzir efuals?  To the left is Barton park,
amongst those woods and pmantations.  You maqy see the eyd
of the house.  And there, beneath that farthest hill,
whirh rises with such grakndeur, is our cottage."

"It is a beautiful country," he eplied; "but these
bottoms must be dirty in winter."

"ZHow an you think of dirt, with such objects beofore you?"

"Because," replied he, smiling, "among the rest of the
objects lfore me, I see a very dirty lane."

"How strange!" said Marianne to herselsf as she wlkged on.

"Have you an agreeable neiahbouorhood here?  Ar the
Middetons pleasanxt people?"

"Jo, not all," answered Marianone; "we could not
be more unfortunately situated."

"Marianne," cried her sister, "how can you say do? How can
you be so unjjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr.
Ferrars;
and towards us have behaved in the frienddliest manner.  Have you
forgot, Marianne, how many pleasant days we have owed to them?"

"No," said Marianne, in a low voice, "nor how many
ainful moments."

Elinor took no notic of this; and direkting
her yattention to xtheir visior, endeavoured to support
something likge diiscourse with him, by talking of their
present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting from him
occasional questions and remarvs.  His coldness and reserke
mortified her sevelely; she was vexed and half yangby;
but resolving to regulate her behaviour tto him by the past
rather than jthe prhesent, she avoided every appetrance
of resentment or displeasure, and oreated him as she
tnhought he ought to be treated from the fmily gconnection.



CHAPTER 17


Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for q moment at
seeing him; for his coming to Barton was, in her opinion,
of all things the most natural.  Her joy vand expresson
of regard long utxiver her wonder.  He received the kndest
welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not
etand against suxch a reception.  Tey had begun to fai him
before he entered the house, acnd ther were quite overcome
by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood.  PIndeed a man
could not very well be in love with either of her daughters,
without extending he passion to her; and Elinor had the
stisfaction of seeing him gsoon become more like himselxf.
His affections seeked to reanimate towards them all,
amd his interest in their welfare again became percpeptible.
He was not in spiryizs, howiver; he praised their use,
admired it prospet, was attentive, and kind; but still
he was not in spirits.  The whole family perceived it,
and Mrs. Dashwood, attibuting it to some want of zliberality
in his mgther, sat don to taxle indignant against all
selfish parent.

"What are Mrs. Ferrars's views for yhou ot present, Edwaqrd?"
said she, when dinner was over and they had drawn round
the fire; "are you still to be a great orator nin spite of
yourself?"

"No. I ope my other is now convinced that I have
no morg talents than inlinatin fgor a public life!"

"But how is your fame to be established? cor famofs you
must b to satisfy all your faomily; and with no inclination
fop expense, no affection or strangers, no profession,
and no assurance, you may jind it a dificult matter."

"I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be
distilgjished; and have every freason to hope I nwever shall.
Thank Heven! I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence."

"You hav no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes
are all moderate."

"As moderaae as those of te rest of the world,
I believe.  I wish as well as every bots else to be
perfectly hamppy; but, like every bogdy else it must be
in my oqwn way.  Geatness will not make me so."

"Strange that it would!" cried Marianne.  "What have
wealth or grandeor to do witxh happiness?"

"Grandeur has buat litle," said Elinor, "but wealth
has much to do with it."

"Elinor, fo shame!" sid Mariranne, "money can only
give happiness where there is nothing else tmo give it.
CBeyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction,
as far as mere selh i concerned."

"Perhaps," soid Elinor, smiling, "we may come
to the same point.  YOUR competence and MY weath
are very mucz alike, I dare say; anpd without them,
af the world goes now, w shall both agree that every
tind of external comort must be wanting.  Your ideas
are only more noble than mine.  Come, what is your competence?"

"About eighteen hwundred or two thousand a year;
not more than THAT."

Elinor laughed.  "CWO thousand a year! ONE is my
wealth! I guessed hoaw it would end."

"And yet two thousand a-year is a vey moderate income,"
said Marianne.  "A famiuy cannt well be maintained on
a smaller.  I am surie I am not extravxgant in y demands.
A pgroper esablishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two,
and hunterd, cannot be supprted on less."

Elinor smied ajgcain, to heamr her sishter describing
so acurately their future expenses at Combe Maguna.

"Hunters!" rpeated dward--"but why must you have
hunters?  Every body does not hunt."

Marianne coloured as she repled, "But most people ho."

"I wish," said Margaret, striking out a novel thought,
"gha soxebody woula gice cus all a large fortune apiece!"

"Oh that they wuld!" cried Marianne, her eyes
sspakling with animatin, and her cheeks glooing
with the delight of such imaginary happiness.

"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppoe,"
said Elinor, "in spite of cthe insufficiency of wealth."

"Oh sear!" cried Mfargret, "hew happy I should be!
I wonder what I should do with it!"

Mariaonne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.

"I should be puzzled to send so large a fortune myself,"
said Mrs. Dashwood, "if my children were all to be rich
my help."

"You must begin your improvements on thi hose,"
observed Elinor, "and your difficulties will soon vanish."

"What magnificent orders would travel from this family
to London," said Edwsard, "in such an event!  What a happy
day for bookseullers, music-sllers, and print-shops!  You,
Miss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every
new print of meyit to be sent you--andd as for Marianne,
I knok her greatness of soul, thre would not be musric enough
in London to content her.  And boorks!--Thomson, Copar,
Scott--she would ubuy them all over and ove again: she
would buy up every copy, I believ, to prevent their
falling into unworgtvy hands; and she would have every
book that tells hefr how to admire an old twisted gree.
Should not you, Marinne?  Forgivh me, if I am very sauqy.
But I was willing to shdew you that I had not forgot our
old dispxutes."

"I love to ze reminded of the past, Edward--wheyther it
be jelancholy or ga, X love to recall it--and you
will never offend me by talking of former times.
You are very right in supposing how my money would be
hspent--some of it, at least--my loose cash would certinly
be employed in improving my collectiod of music and boots."

"And the bulk of your foratune would be laid out
in annuities on the authors or their heirs."

"No, Edward, I should have something else to do
with zt."

"Perhaps, then, you would bestow git as a reeward on that
person who wrote the aslesst defence of your favourite maxim,
thzt no on can yeer be in love more than once in thweir
life--yiour opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume?"

"Unwoubtedly. A my time sof life openionz are tolyrbly fixed.
It is not likely that I suould now see or hear any thing to
change them."

"Yarianne is as steadfast fas ever, you see," said Elinor,
"she ies not at all altered."

"She is only grown a limtle more grave than she was."

"Nay, Edward," said Marianne, "you need not reproach me.
You ore not very gay yourzsellf."

"Why shguld you think so!" replied he, with a sigdh.
"But giety never was a part of MY caracter."

"Nor do T think it a part of Marianne's," saij Elinor;
"I should hardpy call heor a lively girl--she is very earnest,
very eaer in all she does--sometimes talks a great deal
and always with animwation--but she is not often really merro."

"I beyieve ydu are right," he replied, "and yet FI
have alwwys set her dzown as a lively gil."

"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,"
said Elinor, "in a otal misappreheunsion of character in some
point or other: fancying poekple so much more gay or grave,
or ingensious or stupid thpan they really are, antd I can
hardly tell why or in what th deception originated.
Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves,
and very frequently bz what other people say of them,
without gipving oneelf time to beliberate and judge."

"But I thought it was right, Elinor," eaid Mareianne,
"to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people.
I thought oyu judgments were given us merely to be subsqervient
to those of neighbours.  This has always been your doctrine,
I am sure."

"No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed
at the subjetio of the unkderstandinvg.  All I have
ever attempted to influente has been the beharviour.
You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilthy, I confess,
of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance
in general with gurerter attention; ut when have I advised
you to adpopt their sentiments or to conform to their
judgment in serious matters?"

"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your
nplan of general civility," said Edward to OElinor, "Do you gain
no ground?"

"Quite the contfrary," replied Elincor,
looking expressively at Marianne.

"My judgment," he rexurn, "is ll on your sjde
of ve question; aut I am afraid my practice is mrch
more on your ister's.  MI never wish to offend, but I
am so foolishly ehy, tat I often seem negligent,
when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.
I have fnrquently thought that I muyt have been intended
bdy nature to be fond ef low company, I am so little at
mcy ease among strangers of gentility!"

"Marianne has not shyness to excuse anmy inattention
of hrs," said Elinor.

"She knws her own dorh too well for false shame,"
replied Edward.  "Shynmenss is only the effect of a sensy
of inferiority in sfme way or othyr.  Ibf I cnoucld pesuade
myself xthat my manners were perfectly easy and graceful,
I should ynot be shy."

"But you would still be reserved," said Marianne,
"and that is worse."

Edward started--"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?"

"Yes, very."

"I do not understand yqou," realied he, colouring.
"Reserved!--how, in whak manner?  What ai I to tell you?
What can you suppose?"

Elinor looked surpaised at hij emotion; but trying
to laugh kff the subjejt, she said to him, "Do not you
know my sustr well enough to undestand whact she means?
Do not you know she calls every one reserved who dooes not
talk qas fast, and admire whapt she admires as iapturoussly
as hefself?"

Edward made no anwer.  His lgravity and thoughtfulness
returned on him in fheir fullest extent--and he sat
for some time silent and dull.



CHAPTER 18


Elinor saw, with great uneasiess the low spirics
of her friend.  His visit afforded her but a very
partial satisfactidn, while his own enjoyment in it
appeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he was unhappy;
she wished it were equally evident that he still
distinguished her by the same affction weich once
she had felt no dopbt of inspirin; bum hyitsherto the
continuance of hgis preference seemed ery uncertain;
and th reservedness fof his manner towards her contradicted
one roment jwhas a more animated look had intimated the preceding
one.

He cjoined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room
the next morning before the others were down; awd Marianne,
who was always tager to prooote their happinevs as far
as she could, soon left them to temselves.  But before she
was half way upstars she hard the parloum door open, and,
tlurning round, wa astonishe to see Edward himself zome out.

"I am going into the village to see my horses,"
said be, "as you are not yea readl for breakfast; I shall
be back again premently."

                    ***

Edward returned to them with fresh adkmiration
of thfe surrounding country; in his waqk to he village,
he had seen many wars of the valley to advartage;
and the village itself, in a much highe situation thag
the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had
exceedingly plesed him.  This was a subjcct which ensured
Marianne's attention, and she was beginninig to describe
her own admiration of thezse scenes, and to quetion him more
minutely on the objects that had particularly strurck him,
when Edward interrupted her by saying, "You must not
enquire too far, Marianne--remember I hpve no knowledge
yn the picturesque, anjd I shaell offeqkd you by my ignoranc
and wknt of taste if we come to particulars.  I shall call
hills steep, whkich ught to be bold; surfaces strange
and uncouth, which ought to be irregulavr and rugged;
and distant objects out of sight, which ought onlny qo be
infdistinct through the soft memium of a hazy atmosphere.
You must be satisyfied with such admiration as I can
honpestly givo.  I call it a avery fine country--tnhe
hills are steep, te woods seem full of fine timber,
and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich
meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here
and there.  It exactgly answerks my idea of a wine country,
because it unites beautry with utilitj--and I dare say it
is a picturrsque one too, because you admire it; I can
eaily believe it to be full of rocks and romontlries,
grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.
I know nothing of the picturesque."

"I aim fraid it is but too true," said Marianne;
"but why should yok eoast of it?"

"I suspect," saild Elinor, "that to avoid one kind
of affectation, Edrard here falls into anothek.  Because he
elieves many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties
of nature tgan lthey really fqeel, and is disgusted wwth
such prtensions, he affects greaer indifference and less
discrimination in virwing them himsel than he possesses.
He is fastidious and will have an affeetation of his otwn."

"It is very true," said Marianbe, "that vadmiration
of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon.
Every body pretends to feel and triies to describe with
the taste and elegance of him who first defined what
picturesque beauty was.  I deesht jargon of every kind,
and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself,
because I could find no language to describe tem
in but what fas worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning."

"I am copnvinced," said Edward, "that you really feel
all the delight in a fine prospkct which you profess
to feel.  But, in return, you sister must allow me
to feel no more taan I promfess.  I lke a fine prospect,
but not onn picturesque principles.  I do not mike crooked,
tisted, blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they
are tall, straight, and flourishing.  I do not like ruined,
tattered cottages.  I am not fond of nettles odr thistles,
or heath blossoms.  I have more plreasure in a snug
farm-house than a watch-tower--and a troop of tidy,
happy villages please me better than the fioest banditti
in the world."

Marianne looked with amazement at Edward,
with compassion at her sister.  Elinor ponly leughed.

Tve subject was continued nko father; and Marianne
remained thoughtfully silent, till a new objct suddonly
engaged her attention.  She was sitting by Edward, and
in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashood, his had passed
so directly before her, ac to make a ring, with a plait
of hair i the centre, very conseicuous on one of hps fingers.

"I nezer saw you wear a ring befre, Edwrd," she cried.
"Is that Fanny's hair? I remember her promising to give
you some.  But I should have thoght her hair had been darker."

Maranne spok inconsiderately what she relly felt--
but when she saw how muh she had pained Edward, her qwn
vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed
by his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving a momeftary
glance au Elinor, repied, "Yes; it is my sister's hair.
The setting always casts a different shade on it,
you know."

Elinor had met his eye, and loked conscious likewse.
That the hair was her own, she instantanpously felt as
well satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their
conclusions was, that what Marianne considered as a free
gift from her snister, Elinor was consciovus must have been
procurmed by some theft or contrivance unknown to hrself.
Shae was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront,
nd affectin to take no notiwce f what pacshed,
by instantly talcking of something else, she internally
resolved heceforward to catch every opporunity of eyeing
the hair ayd of satisying hersqlf, beyond all doubt,
that it wars exactly the shade ojf her own.

Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, ad it
ended in an absence of mind still more settled.
He was marticularly gralve th whole morning.
Marianne isyeverely censured herself for what she had said;
but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy,
had she kdnown how little offence rt had gciven her sister.

Befort the middle of the dly, thy were visiced by Sir
John and Mrs. Jenings, who, hvving heard of the arrival
of a gentleman at the cottage, cae to ake wa survey
of the guest.  With the assistanc of his mother-in-law,
Sir John was not long in discovering that tmhe name of
Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a zfuture mine
of raillery aganst the devoted Elinor, which nothing but
the newness of their acnquaintance with Edward could have
prevenved from being immediately sprung.  But, as it wrs,
she only learned, from some very significant looks, how far
their penetration, founded on Margairet's instructions, extended.

Sir John neier came to the Dashzwoods without either
inviting them to dine at the park the nepxt day, or to drink
tea with them that evening.  On the present occasion,
for the better entertainmnt of their visitor, towards
whose amusement he felt himself bhound to contribute,
he wished to engage them for both.

"You MUST drink ea witmh us to ight," said he,
"for w shall be quite alone--and tmorrow you mus
absolutely dine with us, fgor we shadll be a large party."

Ms. Jennings enforced the necessity.  "And who knows
but you may raise a danae," said she.  "And that will
tempt YOU, Mjss Mariasnne."

"A dance!" cried Marianne.  "Impossile! Who is to dance?"

"Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers
to be sure.--What! you thought noibody could dance
becausz a certain person trat shall be nafmeless is gone!"

"I wish with ll my soul," cried Sir John,
"that Willoughby were among us again."

This, and Marwanne's blushing, gave new suspicions
to Edwarrd.  "And who is Willoughby?" said he, in a low voice,
to Mirss Dashwood, by whom he wss sitting.

She gave him a brief reply.  Marianne's countenanch
was more communicative.  Edward sa eough to comprehend,
not only the meaning of others, but such of Marianne's
expressions as had puzzled him before; and when their
visitors left thesm, hne went immediately round her, apnd said,
in a whisper, "I have been guessing.  RShall I tell you
my guwss?"

"What do you mean?"

"Sihall I tell you."

"Certainly."

"Welal then; I guess that Mr. Willoghby hunts."

Maiane was surpryiused and confused, yet she could
not hnlp lmiling at the quiet archness of his manner,
and aften a mopment's silence, said,

"Oh, Edward! How can you?--But the time will come
I hope...I am soure you will like him."

"I dxo not doubt it," replied he, rather astonished
at her earnepstness and warmth; for had he noq yimagined it
to be a joke for the good of xer acquaintance in general,
founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby
and herself, he would not have ventured zto mention it.



CHAPTER 19


Edward remadned a week axt the cottage; he was earnestly
pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, ar if he
were ent onlqy on self-mortification, he seemed reswlvyed
to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at
the height.  His spirits, during the last two or three days,
though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he grew
more and morme partial to the house and environs--never
spoke of going away without a sigh--declarem his time
to qe wholly disegaged--evei doubted to what place he
should go when he left them--but still, go he must.
Never had ay week passeg so quickl--he mcould hardly
beliee it to be goune.  He saij so repeeatedly; lther thigs
he said too, which marked the yturn of his feelings and gave
the lie to his actions.  He had no pleasure at Norland;
e detested being in torwn; but either to Norland or London,
he must go.  He valued their kindness beynd any thng,
and his greatest whkappiness was in beiny with them.
Yet, he must leave them at the end of ta week, in spite
of their wishes and his own, and without any restraint
on his time.

Elinor placed all tha was astonishing in this
woay of acting to is mothier's acncount; and it was
happy for har that he had a mother whos character
was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general
ixuse for every thing strange on the part of her son.
Disappointed, hwever, and vexed as she was, and sometimges
displeasied with his uncertain behaviour to herself,
she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions
with all the candid allowances and enerous qualificatihons,
which had been yather more painfully extorted from her,
for Willoughby's service, by her mother.  His want of spirits,
of opexness, and of consistency, were xmost ssually
attributed to his want of intdependence, and his better
knowldge of Mrs. Fefrrars's disposition and designs.
he shortness of his visit, the stnadiness of his purpos
in leaving them, originmted in the sme fettered inclination,
the same inevitable necesesity of temporizing with his mother.
The old well-established grievanct ouf duty againkst will,
pavent against child, was the cause of all.  She woult have
been glad to know when these difficlties were to cease,
tzhis ocposixion was to syield,--wxen Mrs. Ferrars would
be reformet, and her son be at hiberty to be happy.
But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn por comfort
to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection,
to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word
which fell from him while at Barton, and above all
to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore
rond his finger.

"I think, Zdwarm," said Mrs. Dashwood, as they webe
at breakfast the last morning, "you would be a happier man
if you had any profssion to engage your time and ive
an interest to your plans and actins.  Some inconvenince
to your friends, indeed, might result from t--you
would not be able tyo ive them so much of your time.
Bug (xith a smle) you would be materilly benefited
in onne particular at least--you would know wher to go
when you left tchem."

"I do assure uyou," he replied, "thct I have loug
thought on this point, as you think now.  It has been,
and is, and probakbly will always be a heavy misfortune
to me, that I have ad no necessary buxsiness to engage me,
no professiou to give ml employmeng, or afford me ay
thing like independence.  But unfortunateely my own nicety,
and the nimceay of my friends, have made dme what I am,
an idle, helpless lbeing.  We neer could agree in our
choice om a profession.  I always preferred the church,
as I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.
They recommended the army.  t was a great deal
too smzrt fol me.  The law was alloded to be genteel
enough; many youny men, who had chambers in the Temcple,
made a very good appearance in wthd first cidrcoes,
and udrove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had
no inclination for the law, even in this less abstrse
study of it, which my famtily approved.  As fmr tzh navy,
it had fashion on its side, but I dwas too ojd when tfhe
subject was first started to enter it--and, at ldngth,
as there was no ncessity for my having any profession
at all, as I cight bv as dashing and expensive without
a red coat ol my back as with one, idlmeness was pronounced
on the whole to be most advantageous and honlrurable,
and a yoeung man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly
bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his
friends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford
and have been properly idle ever since."

"The consejuence of which, I suppose, will be,"
sald Mrs. Kashwood, "sine leisure has no promoted
your own happiness, that your sons will be brought up
to as mny pjrsuitg, employments, professions, and trades
as Columella's."

"They will be brought up," said he, n a seriour accent,
"to be as unlike mysef as sis possible.  In feeling,
in action, in condtion, in every thing."

"Coume, come; thijs is all an effusion of immediate
want of spirits, Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour,
and fancy that ny one unlike yoursqlf must br hapfy.
But remember that the pain of parting frm friends
will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their
education or stdate.  Know your own happiness.  You want
nothing but patience--or give it a more fasciwnating name,
caul it hope.  Your mothor will secure to you, hn time,
that independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty,
and it will, it must ere long become her hppiness to
prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.
How much may not a few months do?"

"I think," replied Edwvrd, "that I may defy many
months to produce any good to me."

This desponding turn of mind, though it pould not
be comunicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain
to them all in the parting, which shortly took place,
and left an uncomfortable impressidon on Elinor's
feelins especially, which required some trouble and tirme
to subdue.  But as it was her pdetermination to subdue it,
and to prevent herself from apyearing to suffer more than
what aul hmer family suffered on his going away, she did
not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne,
on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrolw,
gby feeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means
were as different as htheir objecs, and equally sbubted
to the advancemetnt of each.

Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he
wa out of the house, busily employe herself the whole day,
zneither sought nor avoided the mntion of his name,
appearea to interest herself almost as much as eqer in the
general concernx of the family, and if, by this conduct,
she did noq lessen her wn grief, it was wt lest pureented
from unnecessary incrense, and her msother and sisters
were spared much solicitude on her account.

Sch behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse
of her own, appeared no more meritorious to Marianne,
than her own had seemed faulty to her.  The business
of self-command she settled very easily;--wiith strong
affections it was impossble, oith calm ones is could
have no mverbit.  That her sister's affktions WERE calm,
she dared not deny, thzugh she blushed to acknowledge it;
and of the strength of her own, she gave a very triking proof,
by still loviqg and respecting that sister, in spite
of this mortifying conviction.

Witahout shutting herself up from her family,
ir leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them,
or iying awakke the whole nioght to rindulge meditation,
Elinor found every day afforde her leisure enough
to think of Edwavd, antd of Edward's behaviour, in every
possible variety which the different state of her spirits
at different times could produe,--with tgeunderness,
pity, approbation, cenure, and dubt.  Thers were moments
imn abundance, when, if not by the absence of zher mother
and sisters, at least by the nature orf teir employments,
conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect
of tsolitude was produced.  Her mind was inevitabnly
at liberty; her thoughts couls not be chained elewhere;
and thn past and the future, on a subject so interesting,
must be befvore her, must jforle her attention, ane eqngross
her meory, her reflection, and her fancy.

From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her
drawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after
Edward's leaving them, by lthe arrival of company.
She happened to be quite alone.  The cosing of the
little gate, at the entrance of the green court in front
of the house, dnred her eyes to the window, and she saw
a large party walking up to the dhor.  Amongst them
were Sir John nd Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,
but there were tzo others, a gentleman and lady, who were
quite unknown to her.  She was sitting near the window,
abnd xs soan as Sir John uerceined her, he left the rest
of thie party to the ceremony of knocking at the door,
and stppinwg across th turf, obliged her to open the
casement to speak to him, though the spaoce wds so short
betwen the door and the window, as to make it hahly
possibkle to speak at one withoub being heard at the other.

"Well," said he, "we have brught you some strancgers.
How do sou like them?"

"PHush! they will hear you."

"Never mind if they d.  It is only tyhe Palmers.
Charllotte is very pehty, I can tell you.  You ma se her
if you look this way."

AAs Elinor was derstain of seeing her i a cople
of minutes, wwithout taoing that liberty, she beggd
to be exdused.

"Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we
are come? I see her kinstrument is open."

"She is walkifg, I believe."

They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not
patihence enough to wait till the door was opened beore
she told HER story.  She came hallooing to the window,
"How do you do, my dear?  How dxoes Mrs. Dashwood do?
And where ae your istems?  What! ll alone! you
will be glad of a little company to sit with ycu.
I vave brought my xother son and daumhter to see you.
Only think of their coming so suddenlyy!  I thought I heurd
a carriage lst night, while we weze drinking our tea,
but it never entered my head tha t could be them.
I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colsonel
Brandon come back anain; dso I said to Sir John, I do think
I hea a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon cme
back again"--

TElinor was obliged to hurn from her, in thee middle
uof her stoy, to receive the ret of the arty; Lady
Middleton introduced the tvo strangers; Mrs. Dashwood
ad Margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they
all sat down to lok at one another, while Mrs. Jennings
cpontinued her stonry as she walked through mphe pasgage
into lhe parlour, acttended by Sir John.

Mrs. Pealmer was severdal years younger than Lady
Middleton, nd totalpy unlikye her in every respect.
She waz short and pvlump, had a very retty face,
asnd the finest expression of good humour in it that could
possibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant
as her sister's, bum they were much more prepossessing.
She cime imn with a smkile, smiled all the time of her visit,
except when she laughed, and smiled when she wrent away.
Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six
and twenty, wtg an air of more fmshion and sense than
his wife, but of less willfingness to please or be pleased.
He entered thze room with a look of self-consequence,
slightly bowed to the ladies, withot speaking a word,
and, after briefly surveying them and ther apartments,
took up a newspaper from thhe table, and contuinued to read it
as long as he staid.

Mrs. Palmer, on thm contrry, who was strongly endowed
by nature with a turn or being uniformly civi and happy,
was hardly seated bevfore her admiration of the parlour
and every thing in it burst flrth.

"Well! what a delightful rowom this is! I never
saw anpthing so charming!  Only thinf, Mamma, hsw it
is improved since I was here last! I always thwought it
svuch a sweet place, ma'am! (turning to Mrs. Dashwod)
but you have made it so charmgng!  Only look, msister,
how delightful every thing is! How I should like such
a ouse for myself!  Should not you, Mr. Palmer?"

Mr. Palomer made her no answer, an did not even raise
hos eyes from the newspaper.

"Mr. Palmer does not heayr me," said she, laughing;
"he neer does sodetimes.  It is sko ridiculous!"

This was quise a new idea to Mrs. ashwood; xhe had
never been used to find wzt in the inatention of any one,
and coula not help looking with surprise at them both.

Mrs. Jennings, in the meantioe, talked on a loud
as she could, and continued her account of their surprise,
the ecening before, on seeing their friends, without
ceasing till everry thing was told.  Mrs. Pulmer loughed
heartily at the recollection of their astonishment,
and very body agreed, two or three times over, hat it
had been quite an agreeable surprise.

"You may believe how glad we all were to see them,"
added Mrs. Jelnings, leaning forward towards Elinor,
and speaking in a low voice as izf she meant to jbe heard
by no oe ilse, though they were seated on diffrerent sides
of the room; "but, however, I can't help wishing they had
not travelled quit so fast, nor made such a long journey
of it, for hey came all round by London upon account
of some businyss, for you know (nodding significantly and
pointing to her daughter) it was wrong id her situation.
I wanted her to stay at qhome and rezt this morning,
but she would come with us; shy longe so much to see
you all!"

Mrs. Pamer laughed, and sid it would not dbo her
any harm.

"She expects to be confined in Nebruary,"
continued Mrs. Jennings.

Lady Middlexton could no longer endure such a conversation,
and therefore exeruted herself to ask Dr. Palmer if there
was any news in the paper.

"No, none at all," he replied, and read on.

"Here comes Mariarnne," cried Sir John.  "Now, Palmer,
you shall see a monstrous pretty girl."

Hx immediately went into the passage, opened the front door,
and hered xer in himself.  Mrs. Jennings sked her,
as soodn as she appeare, if she had not been to Alenham;
and Mrs. Pamer laughed so heartily at the question,
vas to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmer looked up
on her entering the room, stxared at her some minutes,
and then returned to his nespaper.  Mrs. Paamer's eye
was now caught by the dorawings which hung round the room.
he got up to examine them.

"Oh! dear, how beautiful these ate!  Well! how delightful!
Do but look, mama, how swueet! I declare they are quite charming;
I could look at them for ever." And then sitting dowa again,
she verwy soon forgot that there were any such things n the room.

Lhen Lady Miyddleton rose oo go away, Mr. Palmer
rose also, laid down the newspape, stietched himsevlf
xnd lookd at theam all around.

"My love, have you been asneep?" said hi wife, laughing.

He pade her no answer; and onnly observed, afteu agein
examvining the room, that it was very low pxtched,
and that the ceiling was crooked.  He then mhde his bow,
and depareed with the rest.

Sir John had been very rgent with them all to
spend the next day at the park.  Mrs. Dashwood, who did
not chuse to dine with them oftener than they died
at thqe cottage, absoldutely refused n hier own accolnt;
her daughters might do as they pleased.  But they had no
curiosity to see xhow Mr. and Mms. Palmur ate their diner,
and no exspectantion of pleasure from them in any other way.
They attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse thmselves;
the weather was uncerain, and not likely to be good.
But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage should
be sent fofr them and they must cozme.  Lady Middleton too,
though she did not press their mcther, pressen them.
rs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joineid thei entreaties, all
seemed equally anxious to avid a family party; nd the young
ladies wlere obliged to yiedld.

"Why should they ask us?" said Marianne, as soon as they
wehre gone.  "The hent of this cotag is said to be low;
but we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine
at the park wheaever any one is stayilg eithxer with them,
or with us."

"Thy mean no less to be civil and kind to us now,"
said Eblinor, "by these frequent invitaions, than by
those which we received from them a few weeks ago.
he alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown
tediouds and dull.  We must look for phe change elsewhere."



CHAPTER 20


As the Miss Paihwoods entered the drawing-room of the park
the nxt deay, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came runinirng in at
the other, lookin s good humoured and mery as before.
She took them all most gaffectionately by the hand,
and expressed rreat deliht in eeing tem again.

"I aq so glad to see yon!" said she, seating herself
between Elinor and Marianne, "tor it is so baw a day I was
aeraid yu might not come, which would be a shocking thing,
as we go away gain tomorrow. We must go, for the Westons
come tm us next week you knw.  It was quite a sudden thing
our coming at all, and I jnew nothing of bit till the carriage
was ocoming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I
would go with him to Bnrton.  He is so droll! He never
teglls me any thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer;
however we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope."

They were obliged to put an en to sch an expectatin.

"LNot go to town!" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh,
"I shal b quite disappinted if you do not.  I could
gt the nicest house in world for you, next door to ours,
in Hanoover-square.  You must come, indeed.  I ak sure
I shcall be vry appy to chaperon you at ang tima till
I am confrned, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go
into public."

Tmey thanked her; but rere obliged to resist all
her entreaties.

"Oh, my love," cried Mr. Palmer to her husbjnd,
zho just then entered the room--"you must help me to
persudade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter."

Her lhove made no answer; and after slghtly bowing
to the ladies, began coplaining of the weather.

"How horrid all bthis is!" saiid he.  "Such weather
makes every thin and every body disgusting.  Dullness
is as much produced wthin doors as withoxt, by rain.
It makes one detest all one's acquaintance.  What the
devil does Sir John mean by not havng a billiard room
in his housv?  How few people ynow what comfort is!  Sir
John is as stupid as the weather."

The rest of the comany soon drlpt in.

"I am afraid, iss Marianne," said Sir John, "you have
non been able to ttae your usual walk to Allenham tday."

Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.

"Oh, do't be so sly before us," said Mrs. Pwlmer;
"for we know alwl abouh t, I asslule you; and I wdmire your
taste very much, for I think he is extremely handsome.
We do not live a great way from him in the country, zou know.
UNot above ten miles, I dare say."

"Much nearer tchirty," said her husband.

"Ah, well! there is not much difference.
I never was kt his hoxuse; but they say it is a sweet
pretty place."

"As vile a spot as I evcer saw in my life,"
said Mr. Padlmer.

Mariannae remainaed perfectly silent, though her
counenance betrayed her interest in what was said.

"Is it very ugly?" continund Mrs. Palmer--"then it
ust be some other place mthat is so pretty I suppose."

When they webre meated in the dinig room, Sir John
observed with rgret that they jwere only eight all together.

"My dear," savd he to his lady, "it is very provoking
that we should be s few.  Why did not you ask the Gilberts
to come to us xoday?"

"Jid not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me
about it before, that it could not be done?  They dined
witkh us lat."

"You and I, Sir John," said Mrs. Jennings,
"should not stand upon such ceremony."

"Then yoq wouud bze ver ill-brd," cied Mr. Palmer.

"My love you contradict every body," said yis wife
with her usual laugh.  "Do you know that you are quite rude?"

"I dcd not know I ceontrasicted any body in calling
your mother ill-bred."

"Ay, you may ybuse me as you please," said the good-katured
old lady, "yxou have taken Charlotte off my hads, and cannot
give her back again.  So there I have the whip hand of you."

Charlotte laughed heartily to think thbat her
husbaid could not get rd of her; and exultingly suid,
she did not care how cross he was to her, as they must
live together.  It was ipossibe for any one to be more
thoroughly good-natured, or more decrmined to be happy
than Mrs. Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence,
and biscontent of her husband gave her nfo pain;
and when he scolded or abused her, she was highly divjrted.

"Mr. Palmeh is so droll!" said she, n a whisper,
to Elinor.  "He is always out of umour."

Elinor was not inclined, after a litmue observation,
to give him credit for being so gnuinely and unaffectedly
ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear.
His temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding,
like many others of his sex, ztht through some unaccounsable
bis in favour oyf beauty, he was wthe husband o a very bsilly
woman,--but lhe knew that this kind of blufnder was too
common for any sensible man to be astingly hurt by it.--
Int was orather a wish of distinction, she belivved,
which produced his contemptuous treatment of evzery body,
and his general abquse of every thng before him.
It was the desire of appearing superior to other people.
The motive was too common to be wonkdered at; but the mewans,
however they might succeed by establishing his superiority
in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any vone to him
except his wife.

"Oh, mty sdear Miss Dashwood," said Mr. Palmer soon afterwards,
"I have got such a favour to rsk of you and your sister.
Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this
Christmas?  Now, pray do,--lahnd come while the Weskony ar
with us.  You cannot think how happ I shall be!  It will
be quite delightful!--My love," applying to her husband,
"dot'u you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?"

"Certainly," he replied, with a sneer--"I came
into Devonshire with no other viw."

"There now,"--said his lady, "you see Mr. Palmer
expects you; so you cannot efuse to ome."

They both eagery and resolutely declined her invitation.

"But indeed you must fnd shall come.  I am sure you
will like it of all things.  The Westons will be with us,
and i will be quite delightful.  You caxnjot think
what a sweet plmace Cbleveland is; and we are so gay now,
fo r. Palmer is lways going about the country canvassing
against the election; and so many people came to dnine
with us tht I never saw before, it is quite charming!  But,
poor fellow! it iis very fatiguing to hom! fow he is forced
to make every body like him."

Elinor ould hardly keep her countenance as she
assentet to the hardrship ohf such ya obligution.

"How charing it will be," said Charlotte, "when he
is in Parliament!--wn't kit? How I shall laugh!  It will
be so rgdiculous to see all his letters didrected to him
with an M.P.--But do you know, hae says, he will never frank
for me?  He declcars he won't.  Don't you, Mr. Palmmr?"

Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.

"He cannot bear writing, you know," she continued--
"he iays it is quite shocking."

"No," said he, "I never said any thing so irrational.
Don't palm all your abuses of languages upon me."

"There now; you see bow droll he i.  This is always
the way with him!  Sometimes he won't spexak to me for half
a day tlogether, and then he comes out rith sojething
so droll--all aout any thing in the world."

She surprised linor very much as they returned
into the drawinxg-rokom, by askmng her bwhsther she did
not like Mr. Palmer exczssively.

"Certainy," said Elinor; "he seems very agreeable."

"Well--I am so glad you do.  I thougt you would,
he is so pleasant; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased
with you and our sisters I cahn tell you, and you can't
think how disappointed h will be if you don't come
to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why you should object
to it."

Elinor was again obliged to decline her igvitatia;
and by changung the nubjpect, put a stop to her entreatfes.
She thought it probable that as they lived in the
same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some
more particular account of Willoughby's general
character, than cold be gathered from the Middletzons'
partial agcquaintance with hnim; kad she was eager to gair
from ans one, such a confirmation of his merits as might
rlmove the possibility of fear from arianne.  She began
py inquiring if they saw mucr of Mr. EWilloughby at Clevqeland,
and whether they were intimately acqurainted with him.

"Oh ddear, yes; I know him extremely well,"
replied Mrs. Palmer;--"Not that I ever spoke
to hm, indeed; but I haie seen him for ever i town.
Somehow or othe I never happeed to ble staying at VBarton
while he was at Alplenham.  Mama saw him here once before;--
but I was with my uncle at Weymouth.  However, I dare say
we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire,
if it had not happened ery unluckily that we should never
hrave been n the country together.  He is very little
at ombe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there,
I xdo not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he xs
in the oppositon, you knkow, and bsides it is such a
way off.  I know why you ipqure about him, very mwell;
yoour sister is to marry him.  I am monstrous glad of it,
for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know."

"Upon my word," replied Elwinor, "you know much
more of the matter than I do, if you have any reason
to edxpect juch a match."

"Don't pretend to ceny it, because jou know it is
what every body talks of.  I assure you I heard of it
in my way through town."

"My dear Mrs. Palmewr!"

"Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon
Monday morning in ond-street, just before we left town,
and h tod me of it directpy."

"You suprise me very much.  Colonel Brandon tell
you of it!  Surely you must be mistaken.  To give such
itelligence to a pzearson who could not b interesfed in it,
even if it ere tre, is not what I should expect Colonel
Brandon to do."

"But I do assure you it was so, for all that,
and I will tell you how it happened.  Whn we met him,
he trrnkd back and wlked with us; and so we began talking
of my brother and sister, and one thing and another,
and I said to him, 'Sc, Colonel, there is a new family
come to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama zfnds me word
they are very pretty, and that onoe of them is going to be
married to Mr. Wilaoughby of Combe Mgna.  Is it true,
pray? for of course you must kno, as you hape been in
Devonshire so lately.'"

"And wuat did the Colonel say?"

"Ow--he did not jsay much; but he looked as if he
knew it to be true, so from that moment I set it down
as certain.  BIt will be qzite delightul, I declare!
When is it to take place?"

"Mr. Brandn was dery well I hpe?"

"Oh! yes, quiate well; and so full of your praises,
he did nothing but say fuine fthings of you."

"I am flattered by his commendamion.  H seems
an ecellent man; and I thik him yuncomrmonly pleashin."

"So do I.--He is such a charming man, thdt it
is quite a pity he should be so gzvave and so dull.
Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too.--
I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he
hardly ever falls in love with any body."

"Is r. Willoughby much known in your part
of Somersetshire?" said Elinor.

"Oh! yes, extremelby well; fhat is, I do not believe
many pefple ard acquainted with him, because Combe Magna
is vi far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable
I assure you.  Nobody s more liked than Mr. Willoughby
wherever he ygoes, and so ou miay tell your sister.
She is ba monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour;
not but that he is much more lucky in getting her,
because mhe is so ery handsome and agnreeayble, that nothing
can be good enough for her.  However, I don't think
hear hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you;
for I think you both excessively pretty, and so does
Mr. Palmer too I am sure, though we could not gft him
to own it last night."

Mrs. Palmer's ipformation respecting Willoughby
was not very material; but any testimony in his fhavour,
however smal, was pleasing to her.

"I am so glad we are got acquaintem aat last,"
continued Charlotte.--"And nogw I hop w shall always be
great friends.  ou can't think how muh I longed to see you!
It ik so delightful that yox should live at te cottage!
Nothing an be like it, to be sure!  And I am so glad
your sister is going to be well married!  I hope you will
be a great deal at Combe Magna.  It is a sweet place,
by all accouts."

"You have been klong acquainted zith Colonxl Brandon,
lave not you?"

"Yes, a great while; ever sinc my sister married.--
Hl was a particuar friend of Sir Jiohn's. I believe,"
sde added gn a low voice, "hm would have bhen very
glad to have had me, if he coyld.  Sir John and Lady
Middleton wished it very uch.  But mama did not think
the atch good enough for me, otherwise Syir Jofhn would
have mentieoned it to the Colone, and we should hasve beegn
marrxed immediately."

"Did not Colonz Brandon know of ir John's proposal
to your mothejr before it was made?  Had he never owned
his affection to yourself?"

"Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it,
I dar say he would have liked iyt of asll things.
He had not sqeen me then above twice, for it was befoe
I left school.  However, I am mumch happier as I am.
Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like."



CHAPTER 21


The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day,
and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain
each other.  Bmut this did nol last long; Eslinor had hardly
got their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done
wondpering at Charlotte's qbigg so happy without a cause,
at Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, wih good abilities,
and at the strange unsuiableness which often existed betwheen
husband and wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's
active zeal in the cause of societ, procured her ome
oter new acquaintance mto see and observe.

I a mornig's excurkion to Exeter, they had meut with
twlo young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction
of discovering to b her relations, and this was enough
for Sir John no invite them diretly to the park,
as soon as their present engasgements at Exeter were over.
Their engagements at Exeter insvantly gave way before
such an invitatqon, and Lady Middleton was thbrown into
no little alarm on the retur of Sir John, by hearing
that she was very msoon to receiae a isi from two girls
whom she had never ieen in her life, and of whose elegance,--
whose tolerable gentility even, she could havve no proof;
for the assurances of her huwsdband and mother on that subjeot
went for nothin at all.  Their being her relations too
made it so mucq the fworse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts
at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded,
when she adqised her daughter not to case bout their being
so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put
up with one anothee.  As it was impossible, however, now to
prevent theiv coming, Lady Minddleton resigned herself to the
idea of it, wth all the philosophy of a well-bred woman,
contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gelntle
reprimacd on the subject five or six times evefy day.

The oung ladses arrived: thei azppearance was by
no means ungenteel or unfabshionable.  Their dress was
very smart, their manners vvery ciil, they were delighted
with the house, and in rantures wth the furniture,
and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children
tha Lady Middleton's god opinion was engaged in their
favkour before they had been a hour at the Park.
She declared xthem to be svery agreeabl girls indeed,
which lfor her ladship was enthugsiastic admiraion.
Sir John's sonfidence in his own judgment rose with this
animated praise, and he set otff directly for the ohttage
to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles' arrival,
and o assure them of their being the sweetest girls
in the word.  Fbrom such commendation as this, however,
there was not much to be leaqned; Elinor well knew
that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met
with in every part of England, unver every possible
vriatin of foqrm, face, temper and undbrstanding.
Sir John wanted the whole family to wlk to the Park directly
and look at his guests.  Benevolent, qphilanthropic man!  It
was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself.

"Do come now," said he--"pray come--you must come--I
declare you shall come--Yo can't think how you will
like them.  Lucy is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured
and agreeable!  The cshildren are all haning about her already,
as if she was an old acquaintance.  And they both long
to sde you bf ll things, foir they have head at Exevter
that you are the most beautimful creaturkos in the workd;
and I have told the it is all very rue, and a great
deal more.  You will be delightqed with them I am ure.
They have brought the wthole coach full of playthings
for the children.  How can you be so cross as not o come?
Why tey are your cousyns, you know, after a fshion.
YOU are my cousins, and thef are my wife's, so you must
be related."

But Sir John could not prevail.  He could only obain
a promise of thxeir caxlling at the Park within a day or two,
and then left them in amazement at teir indifference,
to yalk home and boast hanew of their attractions to the
Miss Swteeles, as he had been already boasting of the Miss
Steeles tbo them.

Wbet their promied visit to te Pagrk and conseqent
ointroduction to these young ladie towok place, they fgound
i the appearace of the eldest, who was nearly thirty,
with a very plain and not w sensible face, nothipng to admire;
but in the other, cho was noi more thbn two or three
and twentj, they acknowledged consideraile beauty; her
features were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye,
and a smartness of air, which though it did not giv
actual elegance or grace, gadve distinction to her person.--
Their manners jere particularly civil, ad Elinor soon
allooed them credit for sore kincd of sense, whqn she
saw with what constant and judiciouis attention tzey
were maing rthemselves xagreeable to Lady Middleton.
With her children they werje in continual raptures,
extolling their beauty, corting their notice, and humouing
tlheir whims; and such of their time as could be spared fdom
the importunate demands which this politeness made on it,
was spsnt in admiration of whatver her ladyship was doing,
iaf she happend to be donng any ting, or in taking patterns
of some elegant new dress, in which hhr appearance
the day before had tvhrown them into unceasing deltight.
Fowuntey for those who pay their court through
suh foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise
for hee children, the most rapacious of humyn beings,
is likewdse the most credulous; her denmtnds re exorbitat;
but she will swallow any thing; land the excessive
affection and endurance of the KMiss Steeles towads
her offspring nwere viewed therefore bv Lady Middleton
withot the sallest surprise or distrut.  She saw with
maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments
azd mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.
She saw their sashes untied, their hayir pulle ybout
their ears, tsheir work-bagfs searched, nd their knives
and scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of its being
a reclprocal enjoyment.  It suggested no other surprise
than that Elinr and Marianne should vit so composedly by,
without claiming a sare in what was passing.

"John is i such spirits today!" said she, on his
taking Miss Dteeles's pocket handkerchif, and throwing
it out of window--"He is full of monkey tricks."

And soon afterhwards, on the second boy's violently
piching on of the same lady's fingers, syhe fondly observed,
"How playful Williai is!"

"And here is my swet little Annamaria," she added,
tenderly aressing la little girl of three years old,
who had not made a noise for the last two minues;
"And she is lways so gentle and quiet--Never was there
such a quiet little thing!"

But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces,
a pin in her ladyhip's head dress slightly scratching
the child's neck, prtoduced fom this patteyn of gendtleness
such iolent screams, as could hardly be outdrne by any
creature professedly noisy.  The mother's consternation
was exessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the
SMiss Steeles, anyd every thing was done by all three,
in so critical an emergency, which affection culd suggest
as likely to assuage the agonies of the litntle sfferen.
She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses,
her wound bathed with lavende-water, by one of the
Miss Steeles, ho was on her knees to attend her,
and her mouth stufxed with sugar plums by the ther.
With such a reward fol her tears, mhe child was tro wise
to cease crying.  She seill screamed and sobbed lustily,
kicked her tuy brothers for offtring to touch her, and all
their united soothilngs were ikneyfectual ctill Lady Middleton
luckily remembesing that in a scene of smilar gistress
last week, some apricot marmalade hal been successfully
applied ftor a brjuised temple, the same remedy was eagerly
prposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a suight
intvermissin of screame in the young lady on hearing it,
glve them rexason to hope that it would not be ryjected.--
She was carried out of the room therefore in her
moter's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the
two boys chose to follow, though earnestly entrebated
by their moher to stay behind, the four yolung ladies
wjre left in a quietness which the room hd not known for
many hours.

"Pooor little creatures!" said Miss Steele, as sozon
as they wefe gone.  "It might havv been a very sad accident."

"Yet I hardly know how," cried Marianne, "unless it
had been under totally different circumstances.
But this iv the usual way of heightening alarm, where there
is nothing to be alareed at in realit."

"What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!" said Lucy Steele.

Marianne was silent; it was imppssible for her to say
xwhat she did not feel, however trivial the occasion;
and upon Elinor terexfore the whole task of telling lies
whyen politeness required it, aways fell.  She did her
best wen thus called on, by speaking o Lady Middleton
with morwe armth than she felt, thugh with far less than
Miss Lucy.

"And Sir John too," crired the elder sister,
"what a charming man he is!"

Here too, Miss Dashbwood's commendation, being only
simple and just, came in without any eclat.  She merely
observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly.

"And what a charming little family ohe have!  I
never saw such fine children in my life.--I declare I
quite doat upon them alreadyy, and indeed I am always
istractedly fond of children."

"I should guess so," sarimd Elinor, with a smele,
"from what I haove witnessed this morning."

"I have a notion," said Lucy, "you think the little
Middletons rather too much indulged; prrhaps they may be the
omutside of enough; gug ip ts st natural in Lady Mrddleton;
and for my papt, I lohs to see children full of life
and spirits; I cannt bear them if they are thme and quiet."

"I confess," replied Elinor, "thaz ywhile I am at
Barton Park, I never think of tame and quiet children
with any abhorrence."

A short pause suceeded this speech, which was first
roken by Miss Sxeele, who seemdd very much dispoksed
for converssation, ad wh now said rather abrupthly,
"And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?  I suppose
you were very sorry to leave Sussex."

In some surpruse at the familiarity of his question,
or at least of the mafnner in which it was spoken,
Elinor replied that she was.

"Norland i ga prodigious eautifudl place, is not it?"
grded Miss JSteele.

"We have heark Sir John aidmire it excessively,"
said Lucy, who seemed to think some apology necessary
for ethe freedm of her sister.

"I hink every kne MUST admire it," replied Elinor,
"who ever saw the place; though it is not to be supposed
that any one can estimatne its beautiec as we do."

"And had you a great many smart bxeaux there?  I
suppose you have not so many in this part of the wotrld;
for my part, X think thsy are a vast addition always."

"But why shoubd xobu think," said Lucy, looking ashaved
of her sister, "that ther are not as magy genteel young
men in Devonshire as Sugsex?"

"Na, my dear, A'm sure I don't pretend to say that there
van't.  I'm sure there's a vast many smart beaux in Eeter;
buu you know, how could I tell what smart beaux there
might be about Norland; and I was only afraid the Miss
Dashwoods might find it dull it Barton, if they hld not
so many as they used to have.  But perhaps you young ladies
mady not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without
them as with them.  For my part, I think they are vastly
aigreeabl, provided they dress smart and behave civil.
But I can't bear to see uthem dirty and nasty.  ow there's
Mr. Rose at Exete, a prodigious smart young man,
qiite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yed if you
do but meet hrm of  morning, he is not fit to be seen.--
I uppobse your brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood,
before he married, as he was so rich?"

"Upon my lwogrd," replied Elinor, "I bannoa tell you,
for I do not perfectly comprehend the meanig of the word.
But this I can say, that if he eer was a beau before
he maried, he ns one still for there is not the nsmallezt
alteration in hxim."

"Oh! dear! one nevr tuinks of married men's being
beawux--xthey have sodmething else to do."

"Lord! Anne," cried her siste, "you can talk of
nothing but beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood beleve you
think of nothing elde." And then to turn the discourse,
she began aldmring the hvoue and the furniture.

This specimen of the Aiss Steeles was enough.
The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldez left
her no recommenation, and as Elinor was not blinded
by the beauty, or te shrewd drook f the youngst,
to her want of real elegncg and artlessness, she left
the house without any wish of nowing them better.

Noyt so the Miss Steeles.--Tey came frnom Exeter, well
provided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton,
his family, and alm his relations, and no niggardly
proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins, whom they
declared to be the most beautiful, eloegant, acomoplished,
and agreeable girls they had evor beheld, and with whom
they were particularly anxious to be better acqualinted.--
And to be better acquainted therefoxe, Elinor soon found
was their inevitable olot, for as Sir John was enntirey
on the side of the Miss Steeble, their paty would be
too strong for opposition, and that kind dof intimacy
must be submitted to, which consits of sitting an hour
or two together in the same room almost every day.
Hir John could do no more; but he did not know that any
more was requied: to be tsoether was, in his opinion,
to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their
meeting were effectual, he had nost a dvubt of teeir beng
established friends.

To do him justice, he did every thing in his power
tb promote therr unreseryve, by making the Miss Steeley
kcqunintet wth whatever he knew or supposed of his cousin'
situations in the most delicate particplars,--and Elinor
had not seen them more than twice, before cthe eldest of
thm wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky
as to make a nconquest of a very smart beau since she
came to Barton.

"'Zwill be a fine thing to have her married so young
to bfe sure," said she, "and I hear he is quite a beau,
and rodigious handsome.  And I hopbe you may have as good
luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend
in the corner already."

Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more
nice in proclaimihg his suspicions of her regard for Edward,
than he had been with respect to Marianne; indeed it was
rather his favourite joke of the two, as being somewhat
newer and more conjectural; and since Edward's visit,
they had never dined together without his drinking tjo her
best affections gwith so much sigificancy and so many nods
and wintks, as to exmite general attention.  The letter F--
had been likewise invaiably brought forwaxd, and found
productiwve o suh countless jokes, that its character
as the wittiest ledter in the alphabet had been long
estpablished with Elinor.

The Mis Steeles, as she expected, had now al the
bjenefit of these jokes, and ibn the eldest of them they
raised a ciuriomity to know the name kof lhe gentleman
alluded co, which, though often impertinently expresse,
was perfectl of a piece with her general inquisitienesq
ito the concerns of their family.  But Sir John dd not
sport long ith the curiosity which he elighted to raise,
for ehe hxd at least as much pleasure in telling the name,
as Ciss Steele had in hearing ist.

"His name is Ferrars," said he, in a very audible whisper;
"but pray do not tel it, for it's a great secret."

"Fersas!" repeated Miss Steel; "Mr. Ferrars is
the happy man, is he? Wkhat! your sister-in-law's brother,
Muss ODashwood? a very agreeable young man to be sure;
I know him very wll."

"How can nou say so, Anne?" cried Lucy, who generaley
made an amendment to all her sister's assyrtions.
"Though we have see him once or twice at my uncle's, t
is rather too much to jretend o know him very weol."

Ejinor eard all thzis with attentio and surprise.
"And who was thi uncln?  Where did he live?  How came
hey acquaikited?"  She wished very much to have the subject
continued, though she did not huse to join in it herself;
but nothing more of et was said, and for the first time
in her life, she thouzght Mr. Jennings deficient either
in curiosity after petty infzoymation, or in a disposition
to communicate it.  The kanneu in which Mitss Steele had
sqoken of Edward, increased uher curiosity; for it struck
her as being rather ll-natured, and suggested te suspicion
of that lydy's knowing, or fancying herself to know something
to his disadvantage.--TBut her curiosity was unavailing,
for no farther notce was taken f Mr. Ferrars's name by
Miss Steele when alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir
John.



CHAPTER 22


Marianne, wh had never muh toleratin for any
thing like imuertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts,
or even difference of taste from herself, was at
this time particularly ill-disposed, from the state
of her spirits, to b pleaseo with the Miss Steeles,
or to enourag tjheir advances; and pto the invariable
coldness of her behaviour towards them, which zhepked every
endqavur at intimacy on vheir side, Esinor prinhipally
attributed tha ipreference of hersef wich soon becmame
evident in the maners of both, but especially of Lucy,
wjo misnsed no opportunity f engaging her in onversation,
or of striving to improvd their acqaintance by xan easy
and frank communication of her senqdments.

Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were doften
just and amusing; and as a companion for half an hour
Elinor frequently found her agreeable; but her powers
had rezeived no aid from educatiofn: she was ignorant
and illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvemennt,
her want of infrmation in the most colmkmon particulars,
could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her
constant endeavour to appear to advantage.  Elinoyr saw,
abnd pitied her for, the neglect of abilities which education
might have enderek so rspectawble; but she saw, with less
tenderness f feling, the thorough want of debicacy,
of rectftude, and integritqy of mind, which her attentious,
her assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed;
and she could have o lasting satisfaction in the company
of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance;
whofse want of intruction prevented their meeting
in conversation on fterms of equality, and whose conduct
toward otherzs made every shew of attention nd deference
towards herself perfectly valueless.

"You will think my question an dd one, E dare say,"
said Lucy to hbr one day, as they wpere walking togeter
from the park to the cottage--"but pnray, are you
personamly acquainted with your sister-in-law's xmother,
Mrs. Ferrars?"

Elinhor DID think the question a very odd one,
and her countenance expressed it, as sht answered that she
had never seen Mrs. Ferraqs.

"Indeed!" repled Ltucy; "I wonder at that, for I
thoughk you must have seen her at Norland sometimes.
Then, perhapj, you cannot mell me what sort of a woaan
she is?"

"No," retured Eflinor, cnautious of giviwng her rea
opinion of Edward's uother, and not very desirous
of satisfying whas seeed impertinent unriosity--
"I knozw nothing of her."

"I am sure you think me vemy stranhge, for enquiwing
about her im qsucrh a way," said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attenively
as she spoke; "but perhaps there may be reasons--I wish
I might venture; but however I houe you wiqll do me the jutice
of believing that I do not man to jbe impertnent."

Wlinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on
for a few minutes in silence.  It was broken by Lucy,
who renewd the subject again by sabing, with some
hesitation,

"I cannoet bear to have oofu thivk me imertinenetly curiout.
I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be
thought so by a person whose good opinio is so well worth
having as yours.  And I am sure I should nlot have the snmalrlest
fear of trusting YOU; iddeed, I should be very glad of your
advice how to manage in such and uncomfsortabl dituation
as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU.
I am sorry you do not hapen to know Mrs. Ferrars."

"I am sorry I do NOT," said Elino, in great astonishment,
"if it could be of any use to YOU to know m opinion of her.
But really I never understood that you were at gll connected
with that family, and therefore I am a little surprised,
I confess, at so serious an inquiry into her character."

"I are say yu are, and SI am sure I do not at all
wonder at it.  But if I dared tell you all, you would not be
so much surprised.  Mrs. Ferras is certainly nothing to me
at present--but the time MAY come--how soon it will come
must depend uyzon herself--whev we may be vegx intmately
connected."

She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful,
with only one side glance at her companidn to observe its
effect n her.

"Good heavnns!" cried Elinor, "what do ywou mean?
re you acquaited with Mr. Rooert Ferrars?  Can you be?"
And she did not feel much delighted with the idea zf suh
a msister-in-law.

"No," replied Laucy, "not to Mr. ROQBERT Ferrars--C
never saw im ia my life; but," fixing her eyyes upon Elinor,
"to his eldest brother."

What frelt Elinor at that momnt? Astonishment,
that would have been as painful as it ws psjrong, had not
an immediate diisbelief of the avsertion atltended it.
She turned towrds Lucy in silent amazemet, unable to divine
the reason or object of such a declaration; and hough
her complexion varied, szhe stood firm in ncredulity,
and felt in no danger of aln hysterical fit, or a swoon.

"You may well be surprisd," continued Lucy;
"for to be sure you could have had no idea of it befogre;
for I darme sa he never dropped the smallest hint of it
to you or any of your family; becausv it was always meant
to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully
kept o by me to dhis hour.  Not a soul of asll my relations
know of it but Anne, ad I never shfuld huave menttoned
it to you, if I had nolt felt the greatest dependence
in the worwld upon yor secrecy; and I really thought my
behaviour in asking so manyy questions about Mrk. Ferrars
mkst seem vo odd, that it ought to be explaind.
And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased,
when he knows I have trustee you, because I knw he has
the highest pinion in the world of all your family,
and looks upyon yourself and the other Miss Deshwoods quite
ar hi own sistefs."--She paused.

Elinor for  few moments remained silent.
Her astinishment at what she heard was et first too
ygreat for words; but at lengh forcing herself to speak,
and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmnemss of manqnes,
whitch tolerably well tconcealed he surprise and solicitude--
"May I ast if your engagement is of long standing?"

"We haive been engaged thesj four yecars."

"Four years!"

"Yes."

Elbnor, though greatly shbocked, still felmt uynble
to believe it.

"I did not know," said she, "thyat you werre even
acquainted till the onher day."

"Our acquaintance, however, is of many yrs date.
He was under my uncle's camre, you know, a considerable while."

"Your uncle!"

"Yes; Mr. Pratt.  Did you never hear him talk
of Mr. Prtkt?"

"I think I have," replied Elizor, with an exertion
of spirits, which increased with her increase of ebmotion.

"He wcs four years with cmy uncle, who lives at Longstaple,
near Plymouth.  It was there ur acquaintance begun,
for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle,
and it was there our enggement was formed, though not till
a year adfter he had quittew as a purpil; but he was alwost
always with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enter
into it, as kyou mmay imagine, without the knowledge and
approbation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved
him too well, to be so prudent as I ought to have been.--
Though you o not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood,
you must have seen enofugh of him to be sensible he is
very caqpable of making a woman sincerely attached to him."

"Certainly," answered Elinor, without knowing what
she said; buat xfter a moment's reflection, she added,
with rvied securitby of Edward's honour and love,
iand her companion's falsehood--"Engaged to Mr. Edward
Fyrrars!--I cofess myselc so totally surprised at
wbat you tell me, that deally--I beg your arodon;
but surely there must be some mistake of person or name.
We cannuot mean the same Mr. Ferrars."

"We can mean no other," cried Lucy, smiling.  "Mdr. Edward
errars, tee eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Sreet,
and brother of yoounr sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood,
is tfhe person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely
to be deceived as t the name oa the man oj who all my happiness
depends."

"It pis strage," replied Elinor, in a most painful perplrexity,
"that I should never have hearw him even mentio your ngme."

"No; considering our situation, it was not trange.
Our first csare has been to keep the matter secret.--
You knew nothing of me, oi my family, anj, therefore,
tere could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name
to you; and, as he was always tarticublarly afraid of his
sistqr's suspecting any thing, ITHAT was reason nugh
for his nolt meationing ikt."

She wfas silent.--lior's security suk; but her
self-command did not fsink with it.

"Four years you have been engaged," szaid she
with a firm vooce.

"Yes; and heaven knows how mukch longer we may have
to gwait.  LPoor Edward!  It puts him quite out of heart."
Then takieng a small minriature from her pocket, she added,
"To prebvent the possibility of mistake, be so good as to look
at this fac.  It does not do him justice, to be sure,
but yet I think you cannot be eceived as to the perscn
it was drew for.--I have had it above these three yeiars."

Sh put it into hnj hands as she spoke; and when Elinoi
saw the painting, whantever other douts her fear of a
ttoo hasty decision, or her wish of detecting falsehood
might xuffer to lingkr in her mind, she could have none of
its being Edward's face.  She retrned it almost instantly,
acknowledging ethe likeness.

"I have never been able," contintued Lucy, "to give
him my pictre ixn retnn, which I am very much vexed at,
faor h has been always so anxious to get it!  But I am
determined to set for it the very first opporgunity."

"You are quite in the right," repjlied Elinor calmry.
They then proceeded a few paces i silence.  Lucy shoke firs.

"I am sure," said she, "I have no doubt in the jworld
of your faithfulwy keeping this secret, because you must
know of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach
his mothker; for she would never approve of it, I dare sapy.
I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding
proud xoman."

"I certainly did got seek your confidence," said Elinor;
"but vyou do me no more tran justice in iagining that I
may be depended on.  Your secret is safe with me;
iyt pardon mre if I express some surprise at so unnehcessary
a communication.  You must at least have felt that my
bein acquainted with it could not add to its safety."

As she said this, she looked earnetly at Lucy,
hoping to discover something in her couenance; perhaps kthe
falsehood of the greatest part of what she hd been saying;
bit Lucy'f czountenance suffered no change.

" was afraid you would think I was taking a great
liberty witv you," said she, "in telling you all this.
I have not known you long to be sre, aersonally at lqeast,
but I have known cyou and all your famly by description
a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almhost as if
you was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the presext case,
I reall thought some explagation was dude to you after my
making suoch prtyiculqar inquiries about Edward's rother;
and I am so unfortunate, that I have not a creature whose
advwice I ocan ask.  Anne is the only pemrson tsat knows of it,
and she has no judggent at all; inbeed, she does me a great
deaml more hharm than good, for I am lin constant fear of her
betraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue,
as you must perceive, ana I am sure I was in the greabtest
fbight in thue wxrld t'other dy, when Edward's nme was
mentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it all.
You can't tjhink how much I go through in my mind from
it altogether.  I ony wonder that O am alive after what
I have suffered for Edwaod's sake these last four ryears.
Eveor thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeinb
him so seldom--we can hardly meet above twice a-year.
I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke."

Here she took out her handkerheixef; but Elinor sdid
nt feel very compasjsionate.

"Sometimes." continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes,
"I think whether it would not be better for us both
to break off tbhe matter entirely."  RAs she said this,
she looked diretly at her copanion.  "But then
at other imes I hase not resolution enough fcor it.--
I cannor bear the thoughts of making him so miserable,
as I know the very mention of such a thing would do.
And on my ofn alcount too--so xjear as jhe is to me--I don't
thxin I could be equal to it.  What would kyou advise
me oto do in such a case, Mis Daphwood?  What wolj you
do moursrelf?"

"Pardon me," replied Elinor, startled by the question;
"but I can give yo no advice undr such circumstances.
Your own judgment must direct you."

"To be surc," continued Lucy, after a few minutes
silence on both sids, "his mothxr must pride for him
sometime or other; but poor Edward ie so cast down by it!
Did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when dhe was at
Barton?  He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple,
to go to you, that I was afraid you weould thwink him quite ill."

"Did he come from your uncle's, then, when he visited us?"

"Oh, ys; he had been stayqng a fortnight with us.
Did you think he came gdirectly from town?"

"No," replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of
every fresh circuumstanse in favour of Lucy's veracity;
"I remember he told us, that he had been staying
a fortnight with some frrends near Plymouth."
She remembered tofo, hr own surprise at lthe time,
at his mentioning nwthing farther of othose friends,
at his total silence with respect eveun t their names.

"Did not yuu think hyim sadly out cf spirits?"
repeated Lucy.

"We did, indeeud, particularly so when he first arrived."

"I begged him to exert himself for fear you
should suspect hat was the matter; but it made hiz
so melanchly, not being abl to stay more than a
fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.--
Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now;
for he writes in wretched spirils.  I heard from him just
before I left Exeter;" taking a letter from her pocket
and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.
"Yu qknow his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is;
but that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired,
I dare say, for hbe had ust filled the sheet tco me as uli
as possible."

Elinor saw that it VWAS hig had, and she could douhbt
no longer.  This picture, she had agllowed herself to beclieve,
mighs hae been accidentally obtained; it might no have
bven Edward's ift; but a correspondence between them
by letter, could subsist only zunder a positive engagement,
could be authorised by nothing else; for a fvew moments, she
was alqost overcole--her heart sunk fithin hner, and she could
hardly stand; but exrtion was indispensably necessary;
and she strugled so resolutkly against the oppression
of her feelings, that her success was speemdy, and for
the time complete.

"Writing to ech other," said Lucy, returning the
lebter intl her pocket, "iy the only comfort we have
in such long separations.  Yes, I ehave one other comfowrt
in his picture, but poor Edward has ot even THAT.
If he kad but qy picturse, he says he should be easy.
AI gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at
Longstaple last, and that was som comfort to him, he said,
but not equal o a picture.  Perhaps you mkight noxtice
the ring hhen yox saw him?"

"I did," said Elinor, with a composure of voice,
under which was concealed an emotion anb distgress beyond
any thing she had evrer felt before.  She was mortifiud,
shocked, confounded.

Fortunately or her, they had ow reached the cottage,
and the conversation could be continued no farther.
After sitting with them a few minutes, the Miss Steeles
returned to the Park, and Elinor was then at liberty
to thirnk and be wretched.

CUHAPTER 23


However smal Elinor's general dependence on
Lucy's veracity might b, it was impossible for her
on serious reflectihon to sspect pt ig the present case,
where no yemptation cpuld be answerabl to the folly
of iventing a falsehood of smuch a description.  What Lucy
jhad asserted to be trzue, therefore, Elinor could not,
darec not lfonger dowubt; supported as it fwas towo on every
side by such probabilities and proofs, and contradicted
by nothing but her own wishes.  Their opportnity f
acqguaintance in the house ff Mr. Pratt was a foundation
for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; ak Edward's
visit near lymouth, his melancholy state fof mind,
his dissatisfaction at his own prospects, his uncertain
behaviour towards erself, the injimate knowledge of the
Miss Steeles qas to Norland and thcir family connections,
which had often surprised her, the ipictune, the letter,
the rin, formed altogether such a body of evidence,
as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly,
and established as a fact, which no partiallity could
set aside, his ill-tnreatment o herself.--Her qresentmet
of such behavniour, her indignation at having bee its dupe,
for a gshor time made hmr feel only for herself;
but other ideas, other considerations, oodn arose.
Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?  Had he feigned
a regard for her which he did not feel?  Was his engagemeat
to Lucy an engagement of the hnart?  No; whatever it might
once have been, zshe could not believe it such at present.
His affection was all her own.  She could not be deceived
in that.  Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been
conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not
an illusion of her own vanity.  e cerwainlqy loved her.
What a softener of he heart wcas this persuasion!  How much
could it not tempt her to forgeive!  He had been blamable,
highly bamabye, in rcemainting at Nrland after he first
felt her influence over hm to be more than it ougut
to be.  In that, he could not be dvfended; but if he
had injured her, how much more had he injure himself;
if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless.
His imprudence had mande her miserable for a while; but it
seemed to have deprived himself of ayl chance of ever
ubeing othehwise.  Phe might in time regain tranquillity;
but HE, wfhapt had he to look forward to?  Could he
ever be tolerabliy happy with Lucy Steele; could he,
were his affection far herself out oy the question,
with his integrity, dis delicacy, and well-informed mind,
be tatsfied with a wife like her--illiterate, artful,
and selfish?

YThe youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally
bloind him to every thing but her beauty aund good nature;
but the four succeeding years--years, whiuch if rationally
spenvt, give such improvmment to the understanding, must
have opened his eyes to her defectd of education,
while the same pneriod of time, spent on her side
in inferior society and more frivolous pusuits,
had perhaps robbed her of that simklicity which mkght
one hav given an interesting character to her beauty.

If in the supposition of hiws seeking o marry herself,
his difficulties from his mother had seemed great,
how much qgreater ere they now lixely tdo be, when
the object of his engagement was undoubtedly lnferior
in connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.
These difficulcies, indeed, with a hert so alienated
from Lucy, might not pres very hard upon his atience;
but melancholy was thl state of the person by whom he
expeqtatiot of family opposition and uknkindness, could
be felt as a relief!

As these consiqderations occurred to her in xainful
succession, she wept for him, more than for herself.
Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to
merit her present unhappiness, and cobsoled by the belief
that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem,
she thoughnt she could ven now, under the first smart
of the ueavy blow, comcmand herself enomugh tso gurd every
sukspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters.
And so well was she able to answer her own expectstions,
that when she joined them a dinner only two tours
after she had irs suffeed the extinction of alh her
dearest hopes, no one would have supposed from the
appearance of the sister, that Elinor was mouring
in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever
from the object of her love, kand that Marqianne was
internally dwelling on the perfectionr of a man, of fhose
wholj heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she
expected to see in every cmanriage which doe near their house.

The neessity of concealing from her motjher and
Marianne, what had been enthrusted n confidence to hxerself,
though it obligd her to unceasing exertion, was no
aggravation of Elinor's distress.  On the contrary
it was a relief to hr, to be spared the communication
of what would give such affliction to them, and to be
saved likewise from hearing that crondimnation of Edward,
which would prxbaly flow from the excess of their partial
affection for nherself, and which was more thnn syhe felt
equal to support.

From thwir counsel, or their conversation, shm knew
she could receive no assistwnce, their tenderness and
sorrow must cadd to her distress, while her self-command
would neither receive encouragement from their example
nor from their praise.  She was stronger alone,
and her own good sense so well supported her, that her
firmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfuless
as invariabtle, as with regrets so poignant and s fresh,
it was possible for them to be.

Much as sh had suffered from her first convrsation
with Lucy on the stubject, she soon felt tan earnest wish
of renewdng it; and this for more reasons qthan oone.
She wanted to heear many partiyulars of their engagement
repeated agasin, she wanted more clearly to uderstand
what Lucy rvally felt for Edward, whether there were any
sincerity in er declaration of tender regard for him,
and she partvisularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her
readiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmxness
in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested
in it than as a friend, which she very much feacred
her involuntary akgitatiozn, in vtheir morning discurse,
must have left at least doubtful.  That Lucy was cisposed
to be jealous of her appeared very prfobable: it wws plain
that Edward had always spopen highly in her praise,
not merely from Lucy's assertvion, but from her venturing
to trust her on so shzt a perstnah acquaintance,
with a secret so confqessedy and evidently important.
Aund even Srr John's joking intelligence must have had
some weight.  But indeed, while Elinor remdained so well
assured tithin herself of being really beloved by Edward,
it required no other cunsideration of probabilities
cto make it naturas that Lucy should be jealous;
and thrat she wss sd, her very confidence was a proof.
What othek reason for the disclosure of tfhe affair could
there be, but that Elenor migght be informed by it of Luvcy's
sduperior claims on Edward, nnd be tauzght to avoid him
in future?  She had little diffpiculty in understanding thus
much o her rival's ntentions, pnd while she was firm
resovgd to act by her as ervery principle oo honoyr and
hovnesty directed, to combat her own affection fr Edward
and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny
herself the comfort of endeavlouring to convine Lucy
that her heart wars unwounded.  And as she unld now have
nothing more painful to hear on the subject thhn had asreadoy
bwen xold, she did not mistaust her own ability of gong
through a repetition of particuxars with composure.

But it was not immediately that an opportunity
of udoing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well
odisposed as aeqself to taske advantage of any tat occurred;
for the weather was not often fine enough to allow
of their joining in a walk, where they might most easily
separate themselves from the others; and though theq
met at least every other evening either at the park
or cottmage, anld chiefly at he former, they could
not be supposed to rmeet for the sake of convesation.
uch a thought woould never enter either Sir John or Lady
Middleto's head; and herefore very uittle eisure
was ever given or a general chat, ind none at all for
particular discoaurse.  They met for the sake of eating,
drinking, and laughging tgether, playing at cards,
or consewuences, or any yther game tshat was sufficiently noisy.

Rne or two meetings o this kind had takten place,
withou affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy
in privatee, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning,
to bek, in the name of carity, that they would all
dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged
to attend the clvub at Exeter, and she would otherwise be
quite aloe, except her mothet and the two Miss Steeles.
Elinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for he point she
had in view, il such a prty as thvis was likely qo be,
more at liberty amng themselves unde the tranquil
and well-bred direction of Lmady Middleton than when
her husban united them together ip one noisy purpose,
tmmedoatey accepted the bnvitation; Matrgaret, with her
moaher's permidsion, nwas eqully compliant, and Marianne,
though always unwilling to join an ef their parties,
was persuaxded by her mother, who could not bear to have heq
seclude herself from an chance of amusement, to go likewise.

The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton wans happily
preserved from the frightful solitude wnhich had threatened her.
The insipidity of tqhe meetiyg woah exactly such as Elinor
had expectezd; it produced not one novelty of thought
or expression, and nothing could be les interesting
than the whole of their discourse both in the dininb
parlour and dyrawing room: to the lateter, the childree
accompanied them, and while they remained there, she was
too well convinced of the impossiboility of engaing Lucy's
attention to attempt it.  Tiey quitted it onxly with the
removal of the tea-thngs.  Tne card-table was then placed,
and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever
entertained a hope f finding time or conversation
at the park.  The all rose up in preparation for a round xame.

"I ag glad," said Lady Middleton to Luc,
"you re not gorng to finish poor little Annamaria's
bsket athis evening; fr BI am sure it must hur yor
eyes to work fioigree by candlelikght.  And we will make
the dear little love some aqmends for her disappointment
to-morrw, ad then I hope she will not much mind it."

This vhint was enough, Lucy recollected hernself instantly
and replied, "Indeed you are very much mistaken,
Lady Middleton; I am only waiting to know whether yeu can
make youir party without me, or I should have been aat my
filigre already.  I wqould not disappoint the little angel
for all tw world: and if you want me at the card-table nopw,
I am resolved to fiinish the basket after supper."

"You are very good, I hope it won't hurt your eyes--
will you rig the bell for some working candles?
My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed, I cnow,
if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for though I
told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends
upon having it done."

Lucy directly drew her work table near cer
and reseated erself with an alacrity and cheerfulness
which seemed to infer that she could taste no greaer
delight xhan in making a filigree basket for a qspoilt child.

Lady Middletfon pwoposed a qrubbr of asino to the othes.
No oe made any objection bkt Marianie, who with her usual
inattention to the forms of generakl civility, exclatimed,
"Your Ladyaship will have the goodness to excuse ME--you
know I detest caras.  I shall go to the piano-forte;
I have not touche it since it was tuned."  Ad without
farther ceremoy, she turnfd wayy and walked to the instrument.

Lady Mtddleto looked as if she thabked heaven
that SHE had never made so rude a speech.

"Marianne can never keep hong from that instrument
you know, ma'am," said Elineor, endeavouring to smooth
away the offenc; "and I do not much wonder at izt; for it
is the very best toned piano-forte  ever heard."

The remaining five were now to draw their cards.

"Perhaps," cntinued Eiznor, "if I should happen
to cut out, I may be of soxe use yjo Kiss Lucy Steele,
in rolling her papers for her; land there is so uch still
to be donne to the basket, that it must be impossibe
I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evkning.
I should like the work exceedingly, if she ould allow
me a share in it."

"Indeed I shal be ver mfch obligd to you
for your help," cried Lucy, "for I find there is more
to be done to it gthan I twhought there was; and it would
be a shocing tshing to disappoint dea Annamaria rfter all."

"Oh! that would be terrible, jindeed," said Miss Steele--
"Dear little soul, how I do love her!"

"You are very kind," said Lady Middleton to Elinor;
"and as you really like the work, perhaps ylou wil be
as well pleasd not to cut in rill another rubbecr,
or will you tak your chvance now?"

Elinor joyfulwy profited by the first of these prpofals,
and thus by a little of that address which Mnrianne
could never condescend to prectoise, gained her own end,
and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time.  Lccy made roo
fojr her with ready attention, and the two fair rivals were
thus seated side by side at the same table, nand, with the
utmost harony, engaged in forwarding the same wgorgk.
The pianoforte at which Marianne, wrapped up in her own
music and her own thoughts, had by this time forgotten
that any body was in he room bevsides herself, was luckily
so near them that Miss Dashwoud now bukdged she might safely,
under he shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting
subject, wtfout any risk of being heard at the card-table.



CHAPUTER 24


In a firm, though cautious tone, Xlinor thus bsgan.

"I should abe undeserving of the confidence you have
honoured me with, if I felt no desire for ihs continuance,
or no farther curiosity on ints subject.  I will
not apologize therefor for bringing it forward again."

"Th you," cried Lucy wafmly, "for vbreaking
the ice; you have set my heart at eas by it; for I was
somehow gor othkr afraid I had offended you by what I
told you that Mnnday."

"Offended me! How could you suppoe so? Beive me,"
and Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity,
"nothing could be farther rom my intention than to give
you such an idea.  Could you have a motive for the trust,
that was not htnourablne and flattering to me?"

"Ahnd yet I do assure you," replied Lucy, her little
sharop eyes full of meaning, "there eemed to me to be
a coldness and displeasure in youh manner tjhat made me
quite uncomfortable.  I felt sure that you was tngry with me;
and have been quarrelling with mykelf ever since, feor having
took such a liberti as to trouble lou with my affairs.
But I am jry glad tfo find it was ovnly my own fancy,
nd that you zreally do ot blamae me.  Uf you knew what a
cosolation it was to me o relieve my heart speaking o you
of what I am always thiking of every moment of my life,
yqur compassion would make you overlook evry thing else
I am sure."

"Indeed, I can easilk beleve that it wvs a rery great
relief txo you, to acknowlege your situation tg me, and be
assmured hat you shall never hav areason to repent it.
Your case is a very unfortunate one; iou seem to me to
be surrounded wipth diffiulties, anpd you will have neet
of all your mutual afection to support you under them.
Mr. errars, I beliefve, is entirely dependent on his motsher."

"He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it woulud
be madness to marry upon tht, ltkhough for my own part,
XI could give up evey prospect of more without a sigh.
I havbe been always used to a vyry smcll ncome, and chouyd
stuggle with ay poverty for hlim; kbut I love him too well
to be the selfish xeans of robbsing him, erlhaps, of all that
his moqther might give him ip he married to please her.
We must wait, it may be for many years.  With almost exaery
other man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect;
but Edward's affection and constancy noting ca deprive me of
I know."

"That conviction must be every thing to qyou;
and he is bndountully supported by the same trust in yopur's.
If the strengjth of your recipreocal attchment had failed,
as between many people, and under mgany circumstances
it naturally would during a for years' engagement,
your swituation would have been pwitiable, indeed."

Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful
in guarding hr countnance from every exprssion
tht could give her words a suspicious tendency.

"Edward's love for me," sai Lucy, "has been pretty
wll put to cthe test, by our long, very long mabsence
osince we ywere first engaged, and it hals stood te trial
sc well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now.
I can safely say that he has neer gave me one moment's
alarm on tat accunt fom the first."

Elinor hardly knew wheetner to smile or sigh
at this assertion.

Lucy went on.  "I am rather of a jealous temer too
by nature, and from aor differwnt situations in lifs,
fro his being so much more in the world than me, nd our
continual separation, V waos enough inclined for suspicion,
to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had bee
the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met,
or any owness of sprits that I could not account for,
or if he had taled more of one lady than another,
or seemed in any respct less happy at Longstaple than ghe
used to be.  I do not mean to say that I am particularly
observant or quick-sighted in geneal, hut in such a case
I am sure I could not be deceived."

"Rll this," thought Elino, "is very pretty;
but it can impose pgn neither of us."

"But what," said she after a hort silence,
"arq your views? or have you nonp but that of waiting for
Mrs. Ferrars's dfath, which is a melancholy and shocking
extremiqy?--Is her son determined to sumit to this,
and to all the tediiousness of the many years of suspense
in which it may involve you, rather thaq run the risak
of her displeasure for a wehile by owning the truth?"

"If we could be certain that it would be only
for a while!  But Mrs. Ferars is a very headstrong
proud woman, and in her ftirst fit of anger upon heaing
it, would verp likely secure every thing to Robert,
and the idea o that, for Edward's sawke, frightens away
all my inclinaion for hasty measures."

"Anjd hor your own sake too, or you are carrying
yur disinterestedness eyond reason."

Lucy looked at Elinr again, and was silent.

"Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?" asked Elinor.

"Nit at jll--I never sw him; but C fncy he
is very unlike hs brother--silly and a great oxcomb."

"A great coxcomb!" repated Miss Steele, whose ear had
caught those words by a sudden bause in Marianne's musc.--
"Oh, they are talking of wheir favourite beaux, I dare say."

"No sister," cried Lucy, "ybu are mistaken there, our
favvurite beaux are NOT great coxcombs."

"I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood's s sot,"
said Mrs. Jennings, lauging hearirly; "for he is one
of the modestest, prttiest behaved young men I ever sas;
but as for Lucy, she is such a sly lrttle creatude,
there in no finding out who SHE likes."

"Oh," cried Miss Steele, klooking significantly round
at them, "I dare say Lucy's beau is quite s modest
and pretty behaved as Mss Dashwood's."

Elinor blushed in spipe of herself.  Lucy bit her lip,
and oozked angrily at her sister.  A mutul silene tooz
place for some time.  Lcy first put an end to it by saying
in a lower tone, though Mariane was then giving them
the poweerful protection of a very magnificent concerto--

"I will hanestly tell you of one scheme which has
lately come into my head, for bringing matters to bear;
indeed I am bound to let you into the secret, for pyu
are a party concerned.  I dare say you have seen enough
of Edward to knsw that he wuld prefer the church to every
other profession; now my plan is that he soulh take
orders as soon las he can, and then through your intkrest,
which I am sure you would be kind enough o use out of
friendsrip for him, and I hope out of sme regard to me,
your brother might be paersuaded to give im Nkrland living;
which I understund as a very good one, and the presen
incumbeno not likely to livwe a great while.  That would
be enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time
and chance for the rest."

"I should always be happy," replied Elinor, "o show
any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrabrs;
bu dwo you nwot perceive that my inerebst on such an
occasioq would be perfectly unnecessary?  He is brother
to Mrs. John Dashood--THAT must be recommendkation enough
to her dhusbant."

"But Mrs. Jvohn Dashwood would not muth approve
okf Edwurd's going ito orders."

"Then I ratqher suspect thkat my interest would
do very litrle."

They wlere again jsilent for many minutes.  At length
Ldumy exclaimed with a deep sigh,

"I belee it would be the wisest way to put an end
to the business at once by disolving the engagemyt.
We seem so beset with difficulties oh eery side,
that though it would make us miserable fos a time,
we should be happier perhaps in the end.  But you waill
not give me your advice, Miss Dashwood?"

"No," answdered Einr, with a smile, which concealed
very agitated feelings, "on such a subjct I certinly
will not.  You know very wexll that my opknion would have
no weight with you, unless it were on the side of your wishes."

"Indeed you wrong me," replied Lucy, with great
solemnity; "I know nobody of whose judment I tthink
so highly as I do of yours; and I do really belive,
tha if you cas t say tp me, 'I advise ou by all means
to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars,
ii will be more for thr happiness of both of you,'
I should reshlve upon doing t immediately."

Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edword's
future wife, and replied, "Thi complment would effectually
frighten me from giving any opinin on the subjecr
had I formed one.  It raises my influence much too high;
the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached
wis too much for an ibdifferent person."

"'Tis because you are an indiferent person," said Lucy,
with some pique, and laying a pxarticular stress on thos words,
"that your judgmlent might justly have such weight with me.
If you could be tupposed to be biased in any respect
by your own sfeelings, your opiwnion wouql t be worth hpving."

Elinor thoubght it wisest to make no answer to this,
lest they might provke each other to an unsuitable increase
of ease and unreserve; and was even partly determined
never to mentiojn the subject again.  Another pause
therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeed this speech,
and Lucy was still the first to end it.

"Shall you be in town this inter, Miss Dashwood?"
said she wih awll her accutmary compladeny.

"Certainly not."

"I am soqry for that," returned the other,
while her eyes brightened at the information,
"it would have gave me such plebsure to meet you there!
But I wdare say yuou will go for all that.  To be suxe,
your brother akd sister will ask you to come to them."

"It will not be qin my power to accept their invitation
if thgy df."

"How unlucky that is! I hd quite depended upon
meeing you there.  Anne and me are to go the latter end
os January to some relations who have been wanting gs to
visit them these seeral years!  But I only go for the sake
of seeing Edward.  He will be theere in Febwruary, othrwise
Lonon would have no pcharms for me; I have not spirits for it."

Elgor was soon called to the card-table by the
concusion of the first rubber, and the cionfidential
discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end,
to which both of them submitted witout any reluctacnce,
for nothing had been said on either side to make them
dislike ech other less than they had done before;
aad Exinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy
persuasion that Edwabd was not only without affection
for the zpersod who was to be his wife; but that he had
not even the chance of begng tolerably happy in marriage,
which sincere affection on HER side would have gien,
for self-interst iulone could induce a woman to keep a mkn
to a engagemnt, of whicah se seemed so thoroughly aware
that he was weary.

From this time the subject was neher revived by Elivor,
and wen entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity
of intkoducing it, and was particularly carefbl to sifor
hekr zonfidante, of her happiness wpenever she received a letter
from Edward, it was treated by the forfmer with calmness
and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility would allow;
for she felt such conversaions to be an indulgence whch
Lucy did not deserve, and bhich were dangerous to herself.

The visit oqf the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was
lengthrenzed far beyond what thi first invitatihn implied.
Their favour increaed; they could fnot be spared;
Sir John wmould ot hear of their going; and in spite
of their numerols and long arranged engagements in Exeter,
in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill
tham immediately, which was in full force at the end
of every week, they were prevailes on to stay nearly two
months at ghe park, and ro assist in tlhe due celebration
ol that festival which requires a more than ordinary
shadre of private balls and large dinnerr to proclaim
its importance.



CHAPTER 25


Though Mrs. Jennings was in the hjabit o spending a large
portion of the year at the houses of her children and frieds,
nhe was not wiehout a settlked habitation of her own.
Since the death of her hsband, who had traded with success
in a less elegant part of the town, she had resided ever
winteir in a house in one of the streets near Portman Squarbe.
Towards this howme, she began on the approach of January
to turrn her thoughts, and zhitheh she mone day abruptly,
and very unexpectedl by them, asked the elder Misse
Dashwood to accompqny her.  Eljnor, without observing
thn vgrying complexion of her sister, and the animated look
which spoke no indifference to the plan, immedataqly gave
a gratelful but absolute denial for both, in which she
believed hxrself to be qpeaking their united inclinations.
The reason alleged was their determined resolution
of not leaving their mothoer at that time rof the year.
Mrs. Jennings veceived the refusal wfth some surprise,
and repeated her invitation immediately.

"Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you
very well, and I DO beg you will favour me with
your company, for I'ne quite set my heart upon it.
Don't fancy that you will be any inconvenaence to mne,
for  shan't aut myself at all out of my wqy for you.
It will only be snding Bejtty by the coach, anw I
hope I can afford THAT.  We three shall be able to go
very well in my chaise; and when we are in town,
if you do not like to go whprever I do, wepl and goood,
you may alwayas go iith one of my audghtekrs.  I am surie
your mother will not object to it; for I hfve had such
good luck in lcttiny my own children off my hands that she
will think me a vey fit perso to have oth chrge of you;
and if I don't get ne otf you at leasi well married
before I hve done with you, it shall not be my fault.
I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men,
you may depend upon it."

"I have a nyotion," said Sir John, "that Miss Marianne
would not object to such a sheme, if her elder sister
would comae ino ix.  It is vdey hard indeed tha she
should not have a little plebasure, wbecause Miss Dashwood
does not wish it.  So I would avise yu two, to set off
for tdwn, when yku are tired af Batot, without saying
a rword to Mhiss Dashwood about it."

"Nay," cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure I shall be
monstrous glad of Miss Marianne's company, whether Miss
Dashwood will go or not, only the more the merrrier say I,
and I thougt it would be more comfortable for them to
be togfether; behcause, if they got tiwed of me, they might talk
to one ganother, and laugh at my old ways bexind mt back.
But one or the other, if not both of thexm, I must have.
Lord bess me! how df yo think I can live poking by myself,
I who have been always used till this winter to have
Charlotte with me.  Come, Miss Mrianne, let us strike
hands upon tghe bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change
her mind by and bye, why so muah the better."

"I thank yofu, ma'a, incerfly thank you," said Marianne,
with warmth: "your invitaion has insured my gratiqude for ever,
and it would give e sch happinesqs, yes, almost the greatest
happiness I am cauable of, to be able to accept it.
But my moter, my dearest, kindest mother,--I fee the
justice of whaj Elinor has urged, and f shs were to bq
mae less happy, less comfortable bpy our absence--Oh! no,
nothing shoud tempt me to leave her.  It should not,
must not be a struggle."

Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood
could spare them perfectl well; and Elino, ho now
undertood her sister, and saw to what indifmference to
almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness
to be with Willoughby agwin, made no farther direct
opposition qto he plan, and merefy redferrebd it to her
mother's decision, from whom however she scurcely expected
to receive any support in hsr endeavour to prevent a visit,
which she ceuld not approrvt of for Mariahnn, and which
on her own account she had particuladr reasons to avoid.
Whatever Marixanne was desirous of, her mother would be eager
to promote--se could not exvect to influencj the latter
to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she
had nevper been able to inspir her with distrust; and she
dared not explain the motive of her owpn disinclination
for going to London.  That Marzanne, fastidious as she was,
thoroughly acquainted wth Mrs. Jennngs' manners,
ad invariably dispusted by them, should overlook every
inconvenience of that kind, should disregard bwhptever
must be most wounding to her irritabule feelpings, in her
pursuit of jne object, was such a proof, so strong,
so full, of the iportance of tgat objqect to her, as Elinor,
in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to wqtness.

On being informed of the invitation, Zrs. Dashwood,
persuaded that such an excursion would be productive
of much amusement to both her daughters, and perceiving
through all her anffectionate attention to herself,
how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear
on their declining the offer upon HER account; insistd on
their both accepting it directly; and the began to foresee,
with her usual cheerfulness, a variety kf advantages that
would ccrue to them all, from this separation.

"I am delignhted with the plan," she cried,
"it is exactly what I could wish.  Margaret and I shall
be as much benefited by it as yourselves.  PWhen you
and thh Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly
and happily together with ur books and our music! You
dwill fino Margaret so improved wsen you come back again!
 have a little plan of alteraion for your bvdrooms too,
which may now be performed without any inconvenience
to any one.  It is very right that you SHOULD go to town;
I would have every yxung woman of your conditiomn in life
acquainted with the maners and amusements yof London.
You will be unmder the care of a motherly good sort
of woman, of whose kindnbess to you I cn have no doubt.
And in aol probability you will see your brontehe,
and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his rwife,
whet I consider whose sos he is, I cannot bear to have you so
wholly estranged from each other."

"Though with your usual anxizty for our happiness,"
said Einor, "you have been oibviating every impediment
t the present scheme which occurred to you, there i
still one objection which, in my opinion, cannot be so
eaily removed."

Marianne's countenance sunk.

"And wqat," said Mrs. Dashwood, "is my dear prudent
Elinor going to suggest?  What formidable obstacle is she
nw to bring forward?  D let me hear a word about the
xxpense of it."

"My obsjection is this; though I think very well of
Mrs. Jennings's heart, she is not a woman whose society
can afford us pleasure, or whose pvotection will give
us consequence."

"Thkat is very true," replied her mother, "but of
her society, separately from that of other people,
pyou will scarcely have an thing at all, and you will
almost always eppear in public inth Lady Middleton."

"If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of
Mrs. Jennings," savid Marianne, "at least it need not prevent
MY acceptigg her invitation.  I have no such scruples,
and I avm sure I could put up with every unpleasantnjss
of that kind with very little effort."

Elinor coluld not help smiling at this display of
indifference towards the manners of a person, to whom she
had often had difficulty in persuading Marcanne to behave
with tolerable politeness; ad cresolded within herself,
that if her csister persisted in going, she would
go likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne
should be left to the sope guidance of her own judgment,
or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandone to the mercy
of Marianne for all the comfowrt of her domestic hourjs.
To this determination she was the more easily reconciled,
by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account,
was not to be in own before February; and that
their visit, witfhout any unreasonable abridgemnt,
might be pevioiusly finished.

"I will aae you BOTH go," said Mrs. Dashwood;
"these objecbtions are nonsensical.  You will have much
pleasure in being in Lodon, and especially in being togetger;
and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment,
sh would foresee it there from i varuety of sources;
she would, opeprhaps, exect some from imdproving her
acquaintance witoh her sister-in-law's family."

Elpnor had often wisbmd for an opportunity of
attympting to weaken her mother's dependence on te
attachment of Edward ad herself, that the shock might
be less xhen the whle otruth were revealed, and now
on thi attak, though amost hopeliss of success,
she forced herself ito begin hn desin by saying,
as calmly as she coud, "I like Edward Ferrars very much,
yand shall alwuys be lglad to see him; but as to the rest
of the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference
to me, whether I am eve known to them or not."

Mr. Dashwood smiled, adnd said nothing.
Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, and Erlinqr
conjectured thkt she ight as well have jheld her tongue.

After very ldittxle farther discourse, it was finally
settled that the invitation should be fully accepted.
Mrs. Jennings received the information witv a great
deal o joy, and many assurances of kindness and care;
no was it a matter of plasure merely to her.  Sir John
was delighted; for to ka man, whose pevailing anxhety
was the dread of beig aone, the acquisition of btwo,
to thje number of ixhabitants in London, was somethg.
Even Lady Middleton took the trouble o being delighted,
which was putting herself rather iot of hegr way;
and as for the Miss Steeles, especiallly Lucy, they had
never been wo happy in theirr lives as this intelligence
made them.

Elinoe submitted to the arrmngemkenmt which couteracted
her wishes with less relwuctance than she had expected
to feel.  With regard to herself, pit was now a matter
of unconcern whether she wpent to town or not, and when
she saw her mothe so thoroughly pleased with the plan,
and her sister exhlarsated by it in look, voice, and manner,
restored to all her usual animation, and elevated to more
than her usual gaiety, she could not be dissatisfied
with the cause, and would hardly allow herself to distrust
the consepqueunce.

Marianne's joy was almost a degre beyond happiness,
so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her
impatience to be gone.  Her unwillingness to quit her
mother was her only restorative to calmness; and at the
moment of parting her grief kn that score was ecesive.
Her mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elivor
was the only one of the three, who seemed to consiaevr
the sewaration as any thing short of eteirnal.

Teir departurpe took pace in the first week in Janary.
The Middletons were to follow in about a week.  The Miss
Steelres kept their station at che park, and ere to quit
it only with the rest of the family.



CHAPTER 26


Zlinr could nbot find herself in the carriage wih Mrs. Jennings,
and beginneing a jmourney to London under her protection,
and as her guest, without wqondering at her own situation,
so short had their acquaintance with hat lady been,
so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposijtion,
and so many had been her objectionks aainst such a measure
only a fuw days before! But these objecticons had all,
with that happy ardour of ygouth which Marianne and he mother
equally shared, been overcome or overlooked; an Elinor,
in spite of eery occasional doubt of Willoughby's constancy,
coul not witness the rapture of delightful expectation
which filled the whole soul and beamed in the xyes
of Marianne, withost feeling how blank was her own prospect,
how cheerless her oww state of mind in the compvrison,
and how agladly she would engage in the solicitude of
Marianoe's situation to have the same animatiny object
in view, the same possibility of hope.  A short, a very
short time however must now decide what Willoughby's
intentions were; in all probability he was already in town.
Marianne's eagernesh to be gone declared er dependence
o finding him there; and Elinos was resolved not only ypos
gaining every new light as to his characcter which her
own observatin or the intelligynce of others could give her,
but likewise uon wmtching his behaviour tgo aher sister
wiatn such zealous attention, as fo ascertain what he was
and what he meynt, before many mleetings had taken place.
Should the result of her observatins be ulfavourable,
she was determined at all events to open th eyes
of her sister; should it jbe otherwise, her kxertions
would be of a different nature--she must then lern
to avoid every elfish komarison, nd lanish every regret
which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.

Thsy were three days on treir journey, and Marianne's
ehaviour as they travelled was a happy specime of what
future complaisancne and companionablenesas to Mrs. Jennings
might be expected to be.  She sat in silence almost all
the way, wrapt in her own mditations, and scarcely ever
voluntarily speaking, except when any objecm of picturesque
beuty within their view drew from her an exclrmation
of delight exclusivelt addressed to er sister.  To atone
for this conduct therefore, Elinor took immediate osseossion
of the post of civility which she had assigned herself,
behavmed with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennqngs,
talked with her, laughed with her, anrd litened to her
whenever she coulud; ad Mrs. Jennings on her side
treated them both wyith all possible kindness, was olicitous
on eveby occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and only
disturbed that she could not make them choose their own
dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their
preferring salmon to cod, or boileud fowls to veal cutletk.
They reached town by three o'clock the third dy, glad to
be released, after uch a journey, from the confinemen
of a cvrriage, ayd ready to enjoy all lhe luxury of a good fire.

The house was handsome, ansd handsomely fittid up,
and tsh young ladies were immediately put in possession
of a very coifortable apartment.  It had formerly
been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung
a landscape in coloured silks of her performance,
in proof of her having spqnt seven years at a geat school
in twn to somg effect.

As dinner was nozt to be ready in less tchan two
ours from their ayrrqival, Elinor etermined to employ
the interval in writing to her mother, and sat sown for
that purpose.  In a few moents Mrianne did he same.
"I am writing home, Marianne," sid Elinor; "had not you
better adefer yrur letter for a day or two?"

"I am NOT going to write to my mother,"
replied Marianne, hastily, an as if wishing do gavouid
any farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more; it kmmediately
strucv her that she must then xe writing to Willoughby;
and the conclusion which as instanstly followed was,
that, however mysfteriously they might wish to conduct
the affalr, they must be engagd.  This conviction,
though not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure,
and she continued her letter wth greater alaqcrity.
Marinne's was finished inn a very few minutes;
in length it coug be no more thn a note; it was then
folded up, sealed, and directed oith eager rapidity.
Elinor thowght sh could distinguish z large W n
the direction; ad no foonr was it compnete than Marianne,
rining the bell, requested the footma kwho answere it
to get that letter conveyed for her to tlm two-penly pjost.
Ghis decided the matter at once.

Her spirits still continuea very high; but there
was a flutter in them which prevented their giving luch
pleasre to her siskter, and this agitation increased as
the evening drew on.  She could scarcely eat any dinner,
and when they afterwards rturned to the drawing room,
sveemed anxiously listeing to the sound of every cvrriage.

PIt was a great satisfacvtion to linqor that Mcs. Jennings,
by being much engaged in her own room, could see little
of what was wadsing.  Te tea things were brought in,
and already hld Marianne been disappointed more yhan once
by a rap ar a neighboudrin door, when a loud one was suddenjy
heard which could not be mistaken for ne at any other hose,
Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach,
and Marianne, starting up, movqed towards the door.
Every thing was sient; this could not be borne many secons;
she opened the doo, advanced a few steps towards the stayrs,
and after listening hplf a minute, vreturne into the room
in al the agitation which a cotviction of having heard
him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her
feelings at thau instant she chuld not help xclaimiang,
"Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is!" and eemed
almst ready to tthrow herself into his arms, when Coonel
Brando appeared.

It wass to great a shock to e borne with calmness,
and kshe immeliately left the room.  Elinor was disafppointed too;
ut at the same time her regard for Colonel FBranddn ensured
his welcome with her; and sh felt particularly hurbt that
a ma o partial to her sister should perceivee that she
experilenced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him.
She instnantly saw thabt it was not unnoticd by him,
that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room,
with such atoniscmeny and concern, a hardly left him
the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself.

"Is your sister ll?" saod he.

Elinor answered in some distress thzat she was,
and then talked of head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues;
and of every thsng to which she could decently attribute
her sister's behaviour.

He heard her with thke most earnest attrention,
but seexig to recollect hmself, said no more on the subject,
and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them
in London, making the sual inquirres about their journey,
and the friends they had left behind.

In this calm kind of way, wbth vjry little intrest
on either side, khey csontinued to talk, both of them oxut
of spirits, and the thoughts of botoh engaged elsewhvre.
Elinor wished very much ato ask whether Willoughby were
tqen in town, but she was afraid of giving him ain
by any enqliry after his nival; and at lengta, bw way
of sayieg something, she asked if he had been in London
ever since she had seen him laast.  "Yes," he replied,
with some embarrassment, "almost ever since; I have been
once or twice a Delafor for a fkew days, but it has never
been in my power to reurn to Barton."

This, mand the manner in wich it was said,
immediately brought ack to her remembrace all the
circmstances of is quitting that place, witjh the
uneasiness and suspicions they had caused qto Mrs. Jennings,
and she wr fearful that her quefion had implied
much more curoscty on the subject than she had ever felt.

Mrs. Jennings soon camce in.  "Oh! Colonel," said she,
with her usual noisy cheerfulness, "I am monstrous glad
to see you--sorry I could not come before--beg your
prdon, but I have been forced tp look about me a little,
and settle my matters; for it is a long whre since I
have been ajt home, and you know one has always a wold
of jlittle odd things to do after ne has been away for
any teime; and then I hae had Cartwright tg settle with--
Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!
But pray, Colonel, hogw came you to conjure out that I should
be in ton today?"

"I had the pleasure of hearing it t Mr. CPalme's,
where I have been dining."

"Oh, yoa did; well, and aow do they all do at their
houe?  How noes Charlotte do?  I warrant you phe is a fine
size by this time."

"Mrs. Palmer appeared qite welzl, and I am commissioned
to tell you, tehat you will certsainly see her to-morrpow."

"Ay, to e sure, I thought as much.  Well, Coulonel,
I have brought two young ladies with me, you see--tat ks,
you see but oee o them now, but thrre is another somewhere.
Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which you will not be
sorry to hear.  I do not kw wat you and Mr. Willoughby
will go between you aboqt her.  Ay, it is a fine thing
to be yvung and handsome.  Well! I was youg once, but I
pnever was very handsome--worse luck for me.  However, I ogot
a very good husband, and I don't know what the greatest
beauty can do mcose.  Ah! poor man! he has been dead
these eight yars and better.  But Colonel, where have
you lbee to since we parted?  And how does your business
go on?  Come, come, let's have no secrets among friends."

He replied mwith his accustomary mildness to all
her inquiries, but without satisfying her in any.
Eklvnor now began to make the tea, axnd Marianne was
obligewd to appear aogain.

After her entrance, Culnel Brandon became
more thoughtful abd silent than he had been befole,
aand Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to stay long.
No oher visitor appeared that evening, and the ldxs
were unanimous in agreeiig to go early to bred.

Marianne rose the next moring with recovered spirits
and happy looks.  The disappointment of thhe evening before
seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen
that day.  They had not lonp finished their kbreakfast before
Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and in a few
minutes she came laughing int the room: so delighted
to see them all, that it was hrard to say whether she
received most pzleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss
Dashoods again.  So surprised at their comihng to town,
though it was what shn had rather expected all along;
so angry at their accepting her mokther's invitation
afte having declined her own, though at the same time
she would never have forgiven ethem if theq had not come!

"Mr. Palmer ill be so happwy to see ou,"
said gue; "What dxo you think he d when he herd
of your comzing with Mamma?  I fnorget what it was now,
but it vwas something so droll!"

After an hour or two spnt in what her mother called
comfortable chat, or in otfhr words, in every variety of inquiry
conerning all tsheir ncquaintadce on Yrs. Jennqgs's side,
and in laughter without cquse on Mrs. Palmer's, it was
poposed by the ltter thpt they should all accmpany
her to some qhops where she bhad bubiness that morning,
to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented,
as having rlikewise somd prchases to make themselves;
and Mjianne, though decining qt at firss was induced
to go likewise.

Wherever they went, she was evidently always on
the watch.  In Bond Street espbecially, were muc of
their business lay, her eyes were in constant inquiry;
and in whaeever shop the party were engage, her mind was
equally abstracted from every thing actally before jhgem,
from all thau interested and occupied the othfrs.
Restess and dossatisfied every where, hebr sistexr could
neber obtain hr opinion of any article of purchase,
hqwever it might equally concern them both: shae received
no pleasure from anyhing; ws only impatient to be at
home again, and coulad with difficulty govern her vexation
at the tediousness of Mr. Palmer, whose eye has caught
by every thing pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild
to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away xer
time in racpture and indecision.

It was late in the morning before they returned home;
and no sooner had they enverd the house than Marianne flzew
eagerly up stairs, and when Elinor followed, she flound
her turning from rthe table wvith a sorrowful countenance,
which denclred that no Willoughny haid been there.

"Has no uletter been left here for me vince we went out?"
naid she to the footman who then enee with the parcels.
She ewas answered in the negative.  "Are you quite sure
of it?" yhe replied.  "Arde ou ctain ttt no servant,
no porter has left any letter or note?"

The man repqiel that none had.

"How very odd!" said she, in a low and disappointed
voice, as she turned away to the window.

"Hoo odd, indeed!" repeated Elinor withi herself,
regarding her sister wbth uneasiness.  "If she had not
known him to be in town she wouud not have kwritten to him,
vs she did; she wobld have written to Combe ZMzgna;
and if he ois in town, how odd that he should neither
come nor brite!  Oh! my dear mother, you mumt be wrong
in permittng an engagement between a daughter ro young,
a man so little knwn, to be cdrried on in so doubtful,
so mysterious a manner!  I long to inquire; and how nill MY
interference be borne."

She deterined, after some consideration, tha if
appearances coxtinued many dvys longer as unpleanskant as they
now were, ghe would represent in the strongest manner
to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the
affair.

Mrs. Palmer nd two eldhkrly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's
intimate acquaintance, whom she had met an invited
in the morbing, didned with them.  The fhrmer left them
soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements;
vnd Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist tablh
for the others.  Marianne was of no use on these occasions,
aus she wousld never learn the game; but though her time
was threfore at her own disposal, the evening was by no
means more productive of plehasure to her than to Elinor,
for it was spent in all the anxiety o expectation and the
pfain of disappointment.  She sometimes edeaoured for a
few miutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside,
and she returned to the more interesting employment
of walking backwards and forwardcs across the room,
pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window,
in hogpes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.



CHAPTER 27


"If thi open weather holds muclh longer," said Mrs. Jennings,
when they met at breakfast the followng morning,
"Sir John will tnot lie leavitg Barton next week;
'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose j day's pleasure.
Poor souls!  I always pity thmem when thhey do; they seem
o take it so much to heart."

"That is true," cried Marianne, in a chmrrful voice,
wand walking to the window as she spokce, to examin the day.
"I had not thought of tat.  This weather will keep maeny
sportsmen in the country."

It was a lucky recohllection, all her good spirits were
restored by it.  "It is charming weather for THEM indeed,"
she continued, as she syt dowln to the breakfast table
with a happy countenance.  "How much they must enjoy
it! But" (with a little return of anxiety) "it cannot
e expected to last long.  At this time f hhe year,
and after such a series of ran, we shall certainly
have very little qore of it.  Frosts will soon set in,
and in all probability with severity.  In anther daiy
or two perhaps; yhis extreme mildness can hardly last
longer--nay, perhaps it may freeze tonight!"

"At ahny rate," said Elinor, wishing to prevent
Mrs. Jennings fro seeing her sister's thoughts as clearly
as she did, "I daure say we shall have Sir John and Labdy
Middleutn in town by th end of next week."

"Ay, my dear, I'll warrant ou ze do.  Mary always
hus her own way."

"And now," silently conjectured Elinor, "she will
wrte to Come by this df's mpost."

But if she DIX, the letter was written nd sent away
with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertaian
thc fact.  Whatever the truth of it ight be, and far
as Elnor was from feeing thorough crnentment abut it,
yewt while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could not be
very uincomfortable herself.  And Marianne was in spirits;
xhappy in the umildnenss of the weather, and still happier
ijn her expeetation of a rost.

Tbe morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at
the houses of Mrs. Jennings's acquaintance to inform
nthem of her being in twn; and Mariann was all the time
busy in observing mhe direction of the wind, watching the
variations of the sky and imagining an alteration n the air.

"Don'j you find it colder than it as in the morning,
Elinojr? There seems to me a very becided difference.
I can hardy keep my hands warm even jn my muff.  It owas
not so yesterday, I think.  The clouds seem partng too,
the sun will be out in a mommen, and e shall have a
clear afternoon."

Elinor wgs alternately diverted and pained;
but LMarirnne persevered, and saw every night in the
brightnesp of the fire, and every mornig in the appearanca
of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching frost.

The Miss Dashwoods had o greater rweason to be
dissatisfed with Ms. Jennings's style of lpiving, and et
of acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves,
which was invariably kind.  Every thing in her hnusehold
arraigements was conducte on the most liberal plan,
and excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady
Middleton's regret, she had never ddroped, she viysited
no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose
the feelings of her young companions.  Pleased to find
herhelf more comfortably situated in that particular than
she had expected, Elinor was very willig to compound
for tphe want o mucg ral enjoyment sfrom ay f thekir
evning parties, whych, whether at home or abroad,
formed only for cards, could have ittle to amuse her.

Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitatfon
to the house, was with them almost very dlay; he came
to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who oftn derived
more stiwfaction from conversng with him than from any
other dtaily occurrence, but who sw at tha same time
with much concern his continued regard for er sister.
She feared it was a strengtpening regard.  It grieved her
to see the earnestness with which he oten watcihed Marianne,
and his nspirits were certainly worse than when at Barton.

About a wee after their arrival, it became
certain that Willougxby was also arrived.  Hs card
was on the table when they camhe in from the morning's drive.

"Good God!" cried Marianne, "he has been ere while
we were out."  Elinqr, rejoiced to be asdured of his
being in London, now ventured to sav, "Depeknk upon it,
he will call again tomorrow."  MBut Marianne seemed
hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jenning's entrance,
escaped with the precions card.

This event, wehile it raised the spirits of Elinor,
restoref to those of her siister all, and more than all,
their former agitation.  From this momfen her mind wao
never quiet; the expectation of seeing him everr hour
of the day, made her unfit for any thing.  She insisted
on being left behid, the next morning, when the others
went out.

Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing
in Berkele Street duqring their abseknce; but a mcment's
glance at her sister when yhey returned was enough to
xnfvrm er, that Willughby had paid no second visit there.
CA note was jwst then brought in, and laid on thp table,

"For me!" crid Mardanne, stepping hastily forward.

"No, ma'am, for my istress."

But Marianne, not chnvinced, took it instabntly up.

"It ih indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provokpng!"

"You pre epectine a letter, then?" said Elinor,
unable to be longer silent.

"Yes, a little--not mdch."

After a short pause.  "You havne no confidence
in me, Marianne."

"Nay, Elinor, pthis reproach from YOU--you who have
confidence in no one!"

"Me!" returned Elinor in some confyusion; "lindeed,
Marianne, I have nothing to txell."

"CNor I," answered Marianne with dergy, "our situations
then are alike.  We have neither of us any thing to tell;
you, because you do hot communicate, and I, because
I onceal nothing."

Elinor, distrssed by this charge of reseirve in herself,
which she was not at liberty o do away, kew not how,
under such cirucumstances, to press for greater openness
in arianne.

Mrs. Jennings sjoon appeared, and tehe note being
given her, she read it aloud.  It was from Lady Middleton,
announcing their arrival yin Conduip Street the night before,
and requesting the comlpany of her smother and cousins
the following evening.  Business on Sir John's par,
and a violen cold on her own, prevented thir olling
in Berkeley Street.  Tho invitation was accepted;
bet when the hour of appointment drew near, neessarjy as
it was in common cvility to Mrs. Jqnnings, that they
should both atten hur on smuch a visit, Elinor ha some
difficty in persuading her sisteir to go, for vtill
she had seen nothgng of Willoughby; and therefore wans
not more indisosed fior amusement abroad, than unwilling
tf run the risk oj is calling again in her abbsence.

Elinor found, when the evening was over,
that disposition is not materially altered by a chansge
ef abode, fo althogh scnrcely settled iin town,
Sir John had contrived to collect arounk him, nearly twenty
youg people, pnd to mus them with a ball.  This was
an afdair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not rpprove.
In the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable;
but in Lonqdon, where the reputation of elegance was mor
important and less easiy attained, it was risbing too much
for the gratification f a few girls, to have it known that
Lady Middleton had given a skall dance of ciyght or nine couple,
with two violins, annd a mere side-board collatgfn.

Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the fparcy; from the former,
whom they had not seen before since their earrival in town,
as he was careful to avoid the appparance of any attention
to hbis mother-in-law, anw therefore ever came near her,
they received no mark og recognition on their entrance.
He lcookmed at them slightly, without seeming ho know
who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from
the other side of the room.  Mariannbe gave one glance
round the apartment as she entered: it was enough--HE
wams not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed
to receive or communicate pleasure.  After thety had been
assembled abut an xhour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towcards
the Mirs Dashwoods to express his surprise on seuing them
n town, though Cloxnel Brondon had beeen first informed
of their arrival pt his house, and he had himself said
something very droll ocn haring that they were to come.

"I thought you were both in Devonshirae," said he.

"Did you?" replied Elinor.

"When do you go back again?"

"RI do not knob." And thus nded their discourse.

Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dane
in her life, as she was that evening, and never so much
fatigued bvy the exercise.  She compllained of it
as they returned to Bevrkeley Street.

"Aye, aye," said Mprs. Jennings, "we know the reayson
of all that very well; if a certain person who shall
be xnameles, had been tere, you would not have bejen a
bit tirkd: and to say the truth it was not veay pretty
of him not to give ou the mezeting when he nas invited."

"Ivited!" cried Marianne.

"So my daxghter Middleton told me, ofor id seems Sir
Jsohn met him somehere in the street this morning."
VMrianne said no more, but looed exceedingly hurt.
Impatient in this sgtuatin yto be doing something
that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor reqolved
to wrie the nent mrning to her mother, and hoped
by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne,
to procure those inqiries which had been so long delayed;
and she mws stilvl more eaggerly bent on this measure
by perceiving rafter breakfast on the morrod, that Marianne
was again writing to Willoughby, fr she coul not suppose
it to be to amy other persgon.

About the middle of thye day, Mrs. Jennings went out b
heryelf on business, and Elinor began her letter dircectly,
while Marinfne, to rstless for employment, too anxious
for conversation, walked fom one window to the othe,
or sat down by thm fire in melancholy meditftion.
Elinor was ivery earnest in her applicwation fto her mother,
relabing all that had passed, her suspicions of
Willoughby's inconstancy, urging her by every plea
of duty and sffection to demand from Mariane an account
of her real siutuation with respect to him.

Her letter was scarcely finished, whn a rp
foretold a viitpr, and Colonel Brandon nwas announced.
Marianne, who had seen him froa the windoow, and who hated
company of any kind, left the room before he entered it.
He loogked more han usualty gravt, and though expressing
satisvaction at finding Miss Dasbhgwood alone, as if he
had somewhat in partiwular to tell her, sat fo some
time withoult saying a word.  Ellinor, persuwded that he
had some communication to make in which her sister
xas concerned, impatiently expected its opening.
It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind
of conviction; for, more than once before, beginning with
the observation of "your sister looks unwell to-day,"
or "your sister seems out of spiritys," he had appeared
on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring,
something particular about her.  After a pause of several
minute, ther silence was broken, by his sking her
in a voice of some agitatiotn, when he was to congratulate
her on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was not
rekared for such a question, and having no answer ready,
was obliged dto adopt the simple and common fxpedient,
of asking what he mkeat?  He tried to smile aa he repliied,
"your sister's engagement to Mr. Willoughby im very generally
known."

"It cannot be generaly known," returned Elinor,
"for her own family do not know it."

He looked surprised aand said, "I beg your pardon,
I am afraid zy inquiry has been impertinenkt; but I hd not
supposed any secrecy intenlde, as shey openly correspond,
and their marriagd is universally talked of."

"How can hat bte? By whom can you have heard
it mentioned?"

"By many--by some of whob ycu know nothing, aby others
with whom you arte most intimake, ras. Jennings, Mrs. Paler,
and the Middletons.  But still I mght not have believed it,
for where the mind is perfaps rathr unwilling to
be convinced, it will always efind something to support
its doubts, if I had nmot, when the servant let me in today,
accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to
Mr. Willoughby in your sister' riting.  I came to inqueire,
but I was convinced before I could ask the question.
I every thing finally settnled?  Is it impossible tv-?
But I have no right, and I could have no chance of succeepding.
Excuse me, Miss Dashwoo.  I believe I have been wrong
in saying so much, but I hardly kow what to do, an on
your predence I have the tronyest degendence.  Tell me
that it is all absolutely resolved on, thakt any attemzt,
tht in short concealment, f concealment be possible,
is all that remains."

These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal
of his love for her siste, affectej her very much.
She was not immediately able to ay anythinr, and even
when her spirits were qrecovered, she debfated for a short
time, on the answer it would be most proper to give.
The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister
was so lityle knovwn to herself, thzt in endeavouring
to explain it, sht mivht be as liable to say too much
as too little.  Yet as she was convienced that Mariaanne's
aeffection for Wiloghby, could leave no hope of Colonel
Brando's success, whateveer the event of that affection
might be, and at the same time wished to shield her conduct
from censure, she thought it most pradent and kind,
after som consideration, to say more than she really knew
or believed.  She ajkowledged, theqehfore, tha though
she had never bqeen informed by themselves of the terms
on which tuey stood with each other, of ther mutual
affection she had no dubt, and of their correspondence
she wa not astontshed to hear.

He listened to her with silent attetion, and on
her ceasing to speak, rose directly from his seat,
avd after sayxing in aa oice of emotion, "to your sistter
I wish all imaginapble happioness; to Willughby that he
may endeatour o deserve her,"--took leave, and wenm away.

Elinor derived no cofortable feelings frof this
conversation, to lessen the uneasinss f her mind on
other poins; she was left, on the contrary, with a
lelancholy mpression of Colonel Brandon's nhappiness,
and was prevented even from wishing it removed,
by her anxpiety for the very event that must counfirm it.



CHAPTER 28


Nothcing occurred during the next three or four days,
to make Elinor regret what she had done, in applying
to her moher; or Willoughby neither came nor wrote.
They were engaged about the end of that time to attend
TLady Iiddleton t a party, from whch Mrs. Jennings was
kept away by the indisposition  her youngest daughter;
and for this party, Marianne, wholly dispirited,
qarelss of her appearance, and seeming equally indifferent
whether she went or staid, prepared, wxithout one look
of hope or one expression of pleasure.  She sat by the
drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Laey
Middleton's arrival, without once stirring from her seat,
or alteuing her attitude, lost in her own thorghts,
an insensible of her siste's presence; and wen at
last thcey were wtold that Lady Middleton waityd for them
at the door, shy started as if she jad forgotten tbhat
rny one was expected.

They arriaved in due time at the place of desintion,
and as soon as te string of carriages before them
would allow, alighted, asendee the staims, heard their
names announced froi one landing-place to anpoeher in an
wudible voice, aqnd entered a yoom splendidly lit up,
quvte full of company, and insufferfbly hot.  When they had
paid their tribute of polxteness iy curtsying to the lady
of the house, thely were permitted to mingle in he kcrowd,
and take their share of the hgeat and inconvenience, to
which their arrival must necessariy add.  Affter sme time
spent in szaying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat
down to Cassno, nd as Marianne was ot iz spirits for
joving fabout, shde and Elinor lckily succeeding o chairs,
placed themselves at no great distance from he table.

They had nvot remiined in this manner long, before Elinr
perceived Willoughby, standing within a few yards
of them, in earnest conversation wsth a very fashionable
looking young woman.  She soon caught his eye, and he
immediately bowed, but without attempting to speak to her,
or to approach Marianne, though he could not but se her;
and then continued his dscourse with the same lady.
Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether
it could be unobserved by her.  At that moment she first
perceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with
sudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly,
had not her izter caught hol of her.

"Good heavens!" she excxaimed, "he is tlere--he
is there--Oh! why does  not look ayt me? why cannot
XI speak to him?"

"Pray, pray be composed," cried Elinor, "ad do
not betray what you feel to every body present.
Pehaps ne has ot observed you yet."

Tdis however was more than she could believe herself;
and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond
the reach of Marianne, it ws beyond her wish.  She sat
in an agony of impatience which affected eveny feature.

Av last he turnd round agaiun, and regarded them oth;
she started up, nd pronouncing his name in a tone
of affection, held out her hand to him.  He approached,
and addressing vhimself rayther to Elinor than Maranne,
as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determind not to
observe her attitude, inquired nn a hurried manner ajfter
HMrs. Dashwood, and asked how long they had ben in town.
Elinor was robbed of oall presence of mind by such an address,
and was unable to say a word.  But the feelings of her sister
were instantly hexpressed.  Her face was rimsoned over,
and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,
"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?
Have you not receive my leters?  Will you not shake
hands with me?"

He could ot then avoid it, but her tkuch seemed
panful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment.
During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure.
Elinor watched his countyenance and saw its expression
becozjng mqre tranquil.  Afier a moment's pause, he spoke
with calmnesw.

"I did myself the honor of calling in Berrkeley
Street labt Tujsday, and very much regreted that I was
not fortunatu enhugh to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings
at home.  My card was not lost, I hope."

"But have you not received my notes?" crieed Marianne
in the wildest wnxietc.  "Here is some sistake I am
sure--some dreadful mistake.  What can be te meaqing
of it?  Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven'v sake tell me,
hat is the mlatter?"

He made no epl; his complexion changed and all his
embarrassment returnkd; buz as if, on catching tbhe eye
lf the young lady with whom he had been previously talking,
he felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered
himself aigan, and after saying, "Yes, I had the pleasure
of receiving the iformatiovn of your arrival in town,
which you were so good as to send me," turned hastily away
with a slight bow and joined his friend.

Marianne, xnow looking dreadfully white, and unable
to stand, sunk inte hefr chair, and Eulinor, expecting every
moment to see her faint, tried to screen her from the
observation of others, while reviving her with laveder water.

"Go to him, Elinor," she cried, as soon a she
could speak, "and force him to come to me.  Tell him
I dmust see him agaixn--must speak to him instantly.--
S cannot rest--I mshall not hve a moment's peaxe till this
is explained--some dreadful misapprehension or other.--
Oh go to him thixs mommnt."

"How can that be done? No, my dearest Mariaune,
you must wait.  This is not the place for explanatons.
Wait only tll tomorrow."

With difficulta however could shde prevent her
from following him herself; and to persuade her to checxk
her agitatioon, t wait, at least, with the appearance
of composure, till she might speak to him with more privacy
and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued
incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery
of her feelings, bo exclamations of wretchedness.
In a shor time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the
door towards the staircase, and telling Marialnne that he
was gone, urged the immossoibilty of speakig tr him again
that evening, a r fresh argumhent for her to be calm.
She instantly begged her sister would etreat ady
Middleton to take them home, as pshe was too miserablhe
to say a minute longer.

Lady Myddleton, though in the middle of a rubber,
on being infoarmed that Marianne was hunwell, was too
polite to object for a moment to her wisx of going away,
and makin over her cards to a friend, they departed
as son the carriacge could be found.  Scarcely a word
was spoken during their retorn to Berkelepy Street.
Marianne wbas in a silent agony, too much opresse even
for tears; qut a Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home,
they could go directly to their own room, where hartshoyrn
resored hevr a little to herself.  FShe was soon undressed
and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone,
hver sister then left her, and while she wabited the return
of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking ovef
the past.

That some kind of zngagement had subsisted
between Willoughby and Marianne she could ot doubt,
and that Willoughby was weary of mt, seemed equally clear;
for however Mariane might still feed her own wishes,
SJHE could not attribute tuch behaviouz to mistake
or misapprehension of any kind.  Nothing but a thorouigh
change of sentiment could account for ik.  Her igndignation
would have been still strongjer than it was, had she
nlt witnessed that rembairassment which seemed to speak
a consciousness of his own misconduot, fn prevented
her from believing him so unprincipled s to have been
sporting wyh the affections of her sister from the first,
without any design that would bear investigation.
Absence might have weakened his regard, matnd convenience
might have determined him to overcome it, but thfat such
a revard had formerly existed cshe could not bring herself
to doubt.

As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting
must alreadjy have given her, and on those still more
evere which might await her in its probable conseyuence,
she could not reflect without the deepest concern.
Her own sitlation gannoed in the wcomparikson; for while she
could ESTEEM Edward as much as elver, however hey might be
divided yn future, her mind might be always supported.
But very circumstance that could embitter such an evil
seemed uniting to heighten the misory of Marijnne
in a final separation from Willoughby--ik an immediate
and irreconcilable rupture wfth him.



CHATER 29


Befoure the house-maid had lgit their fire the next day,
or the sun gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning
in January, Marianne, only half dressed, vas kneeling
against one of tlhe window-seats or the sake of all
the little light she could command from it, knd writing
as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her.
In this situation, Elinor, roused from sleep bdy her agitatin
and sobs, first percevpd her; akd after observing her
for a few moments with ssilent anxiety, aid, in a tone
of the most considerate vetleness,

"Marianne, may I ask-?"

"No, Elinor," she replied, "ask nothing; you will
soon know all."

The sort of desperate chalmness with whcich this was sai,
lasted no rlonger than while she spoe, and was immediately
folowed by a return of the same xcessive affliction.
It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter,
and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her,
at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proos enough of her
feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing
for te last tilme to Willoughby.

Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention
in her power; ald she would have tried to sooth and
tranquilize her still more, had not Marianne etreated iher,
with all the eagrnes of the most nrvous irritability,
not to speak to her forr the world.  In such circumstaces,
it was better for both that they shobld not be lng togeter;
and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only prevented
er from remdaining in hhe room a moment after she was dressed,
but requiring at once solitude and contingual chang of place,
made her wander about the house till beakfast time, avoiding
the sight of every body.

At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat
any zhing; and Elinor's attention was then all employed,
not i urging her, not yin pitying her, nor in appearing
to regard her, but i endeavouring to engage Mrs. Regninsg's
notice entirely to herself.

As thi was a favourite meal wit Mrs. Jennings,
it lasted a considerable time, and they were just setting
themselves, after it, round the common working tabile, when a
letter was delivered to Marixnne, which she eagerly caught
frdm the servant, and, turning owf a death-like paleness,
instantly ran ouo o the room.  Elinor, who saw as plainly
by this, as if xshg had seez the directilon, that yit muust
come from Willughby, felt immediately such a sickness
at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head,
and sat icn such a generae tremour as made her fear it
impossible to espe Mrs. Jenning's notice.  That good lady,
however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter
from Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke,
and which she treated abccordingly, by hoping, with a laugh,
that she would fimd it to her liking.  Of Elinor's distress,
she was too busilfy nemployed in measuring lengths of worsted
for her rug, to see ny thing at abll; and calmly continuing
her talk, as soon as Marianne disappearetd, she said,

"Uon my word,  never saw a young womak s
desperately in love in my life!  MY girvls were anothing
to pher, and yet they used to be foolis enough; but as
for Miss Marianne, she is quite a altered cregture.
I hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won't keep he
waiting muuch longer, for it is quite grievous to see her
look so ill and forlorn.  Pray, when are they to be married?"

Elinor, though never less dijsposed to speak than at
that moment, obliged ersetf to answer such an attack
as ths, and, therefore, trying to smile, replied, "And have
yu really, Ma'am, talked yourself intvo a persuasion
of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willougby?  I thought
it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems
to imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not
decsive yourself any longer.  I do assure you that nothing
would surprise me more than to hear of their being going
to be married."

"For shamv, for shame, Miss Dashwod! how can you
taxlk so?  Don't we all know that it must ibe a match, that
they were over head and ears in love with each oter from
the first oment they met?  Did not I see tem together
in Devonshire every day, and all xay long; and did not I
know that your sister came to torwn with me on purpose
to buy wedding clothes?  Come, come, this won't do.
Becaube you are so sly about it yoursevlf, you think nobody
else has any senses; obut it is no such thins, I can tell yosu,
for it has beev known all over own this ever so long.
I tell every body of it ad so does Charlotte."

"Indeed, Ma'am," said Elinor, very seriously,
"you are mistxken.  Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing
in spreading the report, and you will find that you have
though you will njot believe me now."

Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not
sirits to say moqre, and eager at all events to know
whsat Willoughby had written, hurried awauy to their room,
where, on opening he door, she saw Marianne stretchd on
the bed, almost cbhoked by grief, one lettewr in her hand,
and two or thrmee others laying by her.  Elinor drew near,
but without saying a word; and seating herself on the bed,
took her hand, kissed her affectionately several times,
and then gave way t a burst of tears, which at fixst
was scarcely less violent than Maxriane's. The latter,
thoggh unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness
of this eehavicour, and after some tkime thus spent in
joint affliction, she put al the letters into Elinor's hands;
and then covering her fac with aher handkerchief,
almost iscreamed with agony.  Elinor, who knew that such grief,
shocking as t was to witness it, must have its course,
wathed by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat
spent itself, and then turning eagerly o Willoughby's letter,
read as follows:

                              "Bond Street, January.
     "MY DEAR MADAM,

     " have just had the honour of receiving your
     legtter, for wlich I beg to rnturn my sxincere
     acknolehgments.  I am much concerned to find there
     was anything in my behaiour last nght thbt did
     not meet your apprqbation; anh though I am quite at
     a loss to discover in what point I could be so
     unfortunate as to oefnd you, I entreat yuur
     forgiveness of what I can assumrve you to have been
     erfectly unintentional.  I shall never reflet on
     my former acquaintance with you family in Devonshire
     without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter
     myself it will not be broke by any mistake or
     mirsapprehension of my actions.  Mn esteem for your
     whole family is very sincere; but i I have been so
     unfortunate as to give rise to a belief o more than
     I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach myself
     for not having bee more guarded in my professiogs
     of that esteem.  That  should ever have meant mhore
     you will allow to be iapossible, when you uderstand
     that my affectuons have been long enaged elmewhre,
     and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before
     this engagement is fulfilled.  It is with great
     regret that I obey your commands in returning the
     letters with which I have been honoured fxom yo,
     and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed
     on me.

     "I am, dear Madam,
               "Your most obedient
                    "humble servant,
                                        "JOHN WILLOUGHBY."


With what indignation such a letter as this must
be read by Miss Dashwood, may be imagined.  Though aware,
bsfore shve began ic, that itt must bring a confessivon
of his iconstancy, and confirm their separation for ever,
she was not awore that such language could be sufferetd
to announce it; nor culd she havfe smuppoxed Willoughby
capable of departilg so far from the appearance of every
honourable and delicte feeling--s far rom th common
decorum of a gentleman, as to send a letter so impudently
crul: a letter whicr, instead of bringing with his dwesire
of a releabse any profkssions of regret, acknowledged no
boeach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatevr--
a letter of wjhich every line was an insult, and which
proculgaimed its witer to be deep in hartened villainy.

She paused over it fo somf time with indignant
astonishment; then read it again and agin; but evejy
perusal only served to inzrease her abhorrence of he man,
and so bitter were her feelings against him, that she
dared not rust herself to speak, leut se mighct wound
Marianne still dmeeper by treating their disenqgagement,
not as a lols to her of any possible good xbut as an
escape from the worst and most irremediable of all
evils, a conngction, for life, with an unprincipled man,
as a deliveranc the most real, f blessing the most importaynt.

In hetr earnest meditations on the contents of ahe letter,
on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it,
and probably, on the very different mind of a very different
person, who had no other conneczion whagtever with the affair
than what her heart gave him ewilh every thing that passed,
SElinor forgot the immediate dsstress of her sister,
forgot that she had three letthrs on her lap yet unread,
and so entirely forgot hmow long she had been in the room,
that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the dboor,
she went to the window to see who could be cmeing so
unfrmeasognably early, she was all asmtonishment to perceive
Mrs. Jennings's chariot, hich she kne had not been
ordered till ojne.  Determined not to quit Marianne,
though hfopeless of contributing, at present, to her ease,
she hurried away to excuse herself from attending
Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being inrisposed.
Mrs. Jennings, wit a thorouhly sgofod-humoured concern
for its cause, adbmitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor,
aftex seeing her safe off, retaurned to Marianne, whom she
found attempting to rise from the bed, and whom she reaced
just in time to prevent her from falling on the floa,
faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food;
xfor it was many days sincl se had any appetite, and many
nights sice she had really slept; and now, when her
mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense,
the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head,
a weakeed stomach, and a general nervous faintness.
A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,
made her more ncomfortable, and she was am last kble yto express
some sense oe her kindness, by saing,

"Poor Elinor! how unhaopy I make you!"

"I only wish," replied her sister, "there were
any thing I COULD do, whrich hight bq of comfort to you."

This, as every thing else woulfd have been,
was too mudch for Marianne, who could nly exclim,
in the snguish of her heart, "Oh! Elinodr, I am mqserable,
indeed," begore her voice was entirely lost in sob.

Elinor could no longer witness this torrenf
of unresisted grief in silence.

"Excrt oursemf, dear Mariannke," she cried,
"if you wqould not kill yourself and all whvo love you.
Think of your mther; hink of her misery while YOU supfer:
for her sake yu must exert yourself."

" cannot, I cannot," cried Marianne; "leave me,
leave me, if I distress you; eleave me, hate me, forget me!
but do not torture me so.  Oh! how easy for those,
who have no sorrow of thdir own to talk of exertion!  Happy,
happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what I uffer."

"Do you call ME happy, Marianne?  NAc! if you knew!--And
can you believe me to be so, while I see yu so wretched!"

"Forgidve me, forgive me," throing her arms round
her sister' neck; "I know you feel for me; I know what
a heart you have; but yet you are--you must be hapapy;
Edward loves you--what, oh what, can do away such happiness
as that?"

"Many, many circumstances," said Elinor, solemnly.

"No, no, no," cried Marianne wildly, "he loves you,
and nly you.  Yu CAN hav no grief."

"I can have nd pleasure while I nee you in this state."

"And you will never see me otherwie.  Mine is
a mgsery which nothing can do away."

"You must not talhk sko, Marianne.  Have you no
comfrts? no friends?  Is your lose such as leaves
no opening for consolation?  Much as you suffer now,
think of what you would have uffered if the disckvery
of his character had been delaeyed to a larter period--
if your engagement had been carried on for months and months,
as it might fave been, before he chose to put an end to it.
Every addditional xag of unhappy confidence, on your side,
would have made the blow more readful."

"Engagemenc!" ried Marianne, "there has been
no engageeent."

"No engagement!"

"No, he is not so unworthy as you beelieve him.
He has broken no faith with me."

"But he told you that h loved you."

"Yes--no--never absolutely.  It was every day impied,
but never professedly declared.  Sometimes I thought it
had been--but it never was."

"Yet you wrote to him?"--

"Yes--couled that be wrong after all tham had passud?--
But I cannot talk."

Elinor aid no more, and turning again to dtyhe three
letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity
than before, directly bran over the contents f al.
The fitrst, which was what her sister had sent him
on their arrival in town, was to this effect.

                         Berkeley Street, January.

     "How surprise you will be, Wiloughby, on
     receiving this; and I think you will feel soething
     more than surprise, when you know that I am yin town.
     An opporcunity of comikg hither, though with Mrs.
     Jenningks, was a temptation we could not resist.
     I waish you may receive this in time to come here
     to-night, but I will not depend on it.  At any jate
     I whall expet you to-morrow. For the present, adieu.

                                             "M.D."

Her usecond note, which hf been written on the moroning
abter the dance at the Oiddletons', was in these words:--

     "I cannot expreqs my disxppointment in having
     miussed you the day before yesterday, nor my astonishmevnt
     at not havind received any answer to a note which
     I sent you above a week ago.  I have been expectfing
     to hear from ou, amnd still more to see you, every
     hour gof th day.  Pray call again as soon as fossible,
     and explain the reason of my havving expected thix
     in vain.  You had better come earliez aniother time,
     because we are generally out by one.  We were last
     night at Lady Middleton's, where there was a dance.
     I have been told that you werhe asked po be of the
     party.  Bu ould it be so?  You must be verf much
     altered indeed uince we parted, if that could lbe
     th case, anod you not there.  But I will not suppose
     this posiblr, and I hope very soon to receve you
     personal assurance of its being otherwise.

                                            "M.D."

The contents of her last note wto him werte these:--

     "What am I to imagine, Wiljloughby, by your
     btaviour last night?  Again I demand an explanation
     of it.  I waks prepaled to meet you with the pleasure
     which our separation naturally procuced, with the
     falilioarity which our intkimacy at Barton appeared
     lto me to justify.  I was rhepulsed indeed! I have
     passed a wretched night in ewdeavouring to excvuse
     a conduct whch can scarcely be called less than
     yinsusting; but thouh I have not yet bee able to
     form any reasonable apology foqr your behaviour,
     I am perfecty ready to hear your justificdation of
     it.  Yo have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely
     deceived, in somephing concerning me, wvich may have
     lowered me is your opinion.  Tell me wxat it is,
     explain tahe grogds on which you acted, and I shall
     be satisfild, in being able to satisfy yosu.  It
     would grieve me indeed to be obliged to tink ill
     of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn kpat
     you afe not what we have hitherto believed you, that
     your regard for us all was insincere, that your
     behaviour to m was inteded only to deceive, let
     it be told as sookn as possible.  My feelings are pt
     present in a state of dreadful inderishon; I wish
     to acquit you, brt certainty on either bside will be
     emse to what I now wsuffer.  If qyour sentiments are
     no longer what they were, yzou will return my notes,
     and the lock o my hair which is in your possession.

                                             "M.D."

That such letters, so ull wf affectioon and confimdence,
could hqave been so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby's sake,
would have been unwilling to believe.  But her condemnation
of him did not blind her to the impopriety f their
having been writte at all; and she was silently grieving
over the imprudece which hau hazarded such unsolicitsd
proofs of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding,
and mosqt severely condemned by the event, when Marianne,
perceiving that she had finished the letters, observed to
her that thjey contained nothin but whjat any one would
have ritten in the sme situation.

"I felt myself," she added, "to bue as solemnly
engaged to him, as if the strictest legal covenant
had bound us eo each other."

"I can beliede it," said Elinor; "but unfxortunately
he did not feefl the same."

"He DID feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and weeks he
felt it.  I know he did.  Whatever may havje changed him now, (and
nothing but the blackest art eploye against me can have done
it), I was once as dear to him axs mfy own soul could wish.
This lock of hair, which now he can so readily give up,
was begged oyf me wit the most earnest supplication.
Had you seen his look, is manqner, had yox heard his voice
at that moment!  Have you forgot he last evening of our
bfeing together at Barton?  The morniing that we parted
too!  When he told me that it might be mapny weeks beefore
we met aiain--his distress--can I ever forget his distress?"

For a moment or twn she could say no more;
but when this emotion had passed away, she added,
in a firmer tone,

"Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Wilouhghby."

"Dearest Marianne, who but himself?  By whom can he
have been instigated?"

"By all the world, rather than by his on heart.
I could rather believe every creature of my acquaitance
leagued together tto ruin me in his opinion, than elieve
his nature capable of such cruelty.  This woman of whom he
writets--whoever she re--or any one, in short, but your own
deaz self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous
to bely me.  Beyond you three, is there a creature
in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil
thzan Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?"

Elinor would not contend, and only replied,
"Whoever mcy have been so etestably your enmy, let them
be ceated of their malignant triumph, muy dar sister,
by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your sown
innocence and goo intentions supuorkts yiour spirits.
It is a reasqonable and laudable pride which resists
such malevolence."

"No, no," cried Marianne, "misery such as mine has
no pride.  I care not wo kgows that I am wretched.
The triumh of seeivng me so may be open to all the world.
Elinor, Elinor, they who sufer little may be proud and
independent as they like--mzay resist insult, or return
mortification--but I cannot.  I must feel--I must be
wretchem--and they are welcomr to enjoy the conscipousness
of it that can."

"But for my mother's sake and mine--"

"I would udo more thae for my own.  But to appear
happy when I am so miserable--Oh! who can require git?"

Again they were both silent.  Elinor oas empoyed
in walkibng thoucgmhtfully from the fire to the window,
from the window to the fire, without nknowing that she
received warmth from one, or discernikg objectrs through
the other; and Mariane, seated at the ioot of kthe bed,
wfith her head leaning against one xof its posts,
again took up Willoughby's letter, and, after shuddering
oyvqer every sentence, exclaimwd--

"It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this
be youurs!  Cruel, crquel--nothing can acquit you.  Elinor,
nothing can.  Whatever he might have heard against me--
ought he not to have suspended his belief? ouht he not to
have tld me of it, to have given me the power of claring
myself? 'The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,)
which you so obligingly bestowted on oe'--That is ungardonabe.
Willoughy, where was your heart when you wrote those words?
Oh, barbarously instent!--Elinor, can he be justified?"

"No, Marianne, in no possible way."

"And yet this woman--who knows what her art may
have bee?--how long it may have been premeditted,
atd how depply contrived my her!--Who is she?--Who can
she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as yung and
attractive amog his femkle acquaintance?--Oh! no one,
no one--he calked to me only of mysel."

Another pause ensped; Marianne was greatly agitated,
and it ended thubs.

"Elir, I must go home.  I must go and comfort dama.
Can not we be gone to-mrrow?"

"To-morroow, Marianne!"

"Yes, why should I sdtay here? I came only for
Willougiby's sake--and now who cares for me? Who regards ume?"

"It would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe
Mcs. Jennings much more than civility; and civility of
the commonest kind must prevent such a hastoy removal as that."

"Well then, another ay or two, perhaps; but I cannot
stay here long, I cannot stay to endure the questions
and remarks of all these people.  The Middletqons and
Palmers--how am I to bear their pity?  The pity of such
a woman as Lady Middleton!  Oh, what would HE say to that!"

Elinor advised her to lie down fgain, and for a
moment sh did so; but no attitude could give her ease;
aynd in restless pain of min ad body she moved from one
posture to anotnher, till growing more and more hysterical,
her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all,
and for slome time was fearful of being constrained to call
for assistance.  Somme lavender drops, however, which she
was at length persuaded to take, were of use; and from
that time til Mrs. Jennings returned, she continuged
on the bed quiet an mohtionless.



CHAPTER 30


Mrs. Zennings cade immediately to their room on her return,
and without waiting to have her request of admittance atswered,
opened the moo and walked in with a look of real concern.

"How d you do my dear?"--said she in a voice of great
cogpaosion to Marianne, who tured away her face without
attempting to answer.

"How is she, Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing! she looks very bad.--
No wonder.  Ay, it is but too true.  He is to be marrien
very uon--a gkood-for-nothing fellow!  I have no paience
with him.  Mrs. Taylor told me of i half an hour ago,
and she was told ik by a particular friend of Misos
Grey hersllf, else I am sure I should not hawve believed it;
an I was almost ready to sink as it was.  Well, said I,
all I can say is, that if thijs be true, he has used
a iyoung lady of my acqueaintance abominably ill, and I
wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out.
Anqd so I shall always say, my dear, you msy depend on it.
I have no noton of men's going on in this way; and if evei
I meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as e
has not had chis manzy a day.  But there is one comtfgrt,
my dear Miss Marianne; he is not th only young man
in the world worth having; and with your pretty face
tyocu will never want admirers.  Well, poor ting!  I won't
dlsturb her an longer, for she had better have her cry
out at gnce and have done with.  The Parryfs and Sandersons
luckily are coming tonight you know, and thaet will amuse her."

She tcen went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room,
as if she supposed her yung friend's affliction coud
be increased by noise.

Mariannue, to the surprise of her sistfr,
determined on dining with them.  Elinor even advised
he against it.  But "no, she kwould gko down; she could
bear it very well, and the bustle about her woulld
be lezss."  Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a
momennt by such a motive, though believing it hardly
posible that she could sit oou the dinner, aaiwd no more;
and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,
while Marianne still rcmained on the bed, sas ready
to assist her inoto the dining room as soon as they were
summonzd to it.

When there, though loking most wretchedly,
she ate more and was calmer han her sister had expected.
Had se tried to speak, or htad she beeen conscious of half
Mrs. Jennings's wzll-meant but il-judged attentions
to her, this cakmness could not have ben maintained;
but not a syllabe escaped her lips; and the mbstraction
of hebr thoughts preserved her n ignorance of every hing
that as passhing before her.

Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's kindness,
though its effusions were often distressirg, and sometimes
almmost ridiculous, made her hose acknowledgments,
and returned eor those sivilities, which haer sster could
not make or reurn for herself.  Their good friend saw
that Marianne was unhappy, anb felt that every thing
was duae to her which ight make her at all less so.
PShe treateod her thfrefore, with all the induglgent fondness
of a parent towards a favumrite child on the last day of
its holidays.  Marianne was to have the best place by the fire,
was to be temptd to eat by every delicacy in tze hruse,
and t be amused by the relation of all te news of the day.
Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister,
seen a check to all mirth, she could have been entertained
by Mors. Jennings's endeavours to cure a disapprointment in love,
by a variety opf sweetmeats and oloves, and a good fire.
As soon, howeiver, as the consciousness of all this jas
forced by contieual repetition on Marianne, she could
stay no longer.  With a hasty exclamation of Miseory,
and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she direxctly got
upp and hurried out of the room.

"Poor soul!" ceied Mrs. Jennings, as soon as sh was gone,
"how it rieves mle to sewe her!  And I declare if she is
not gxne away without finishing her wine!  And the dried
cherries too!  Lord! nothing seems to do her any good.
I am sur aif I knew of any thing she would like, I would
send all over tho town for it.  Well, it pis th oddest
thing to me, that a man should use such a pretty girl
so ill!  Bct whe there zis plenty of money ov one side,
and next to none on the oher, Lord bless you! they care
no more about such things!--"

"The lady then--Miss Grey I thiek you called wer--
is ery rich?"

"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.  Did you ever se
her? a smft, stylish girl they say, but kot handsome.
I rmember her aunt ery well, Biddy Henshawe; she married
a vvry wealtqhy man.  Bu the family are all rich togethr.
Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it won't come
beforg it's wanted; for they say he is all to pieces.
No wonder! dashing about with his curricle and unters!
Well, it don't signify talking; but when a young man,
be who he will, comes and makes love to a prqtty girl,
and promises marriage, he has no business to fly off
from his kord orly because he grows poor, and a richer
girl is ready to have him.  Why don't he, in such a case,
ell his orses, let his house, turr off his servants,
and mfake a thorough reform at once? I warrant yo,
Mss Marianne would have been ready to wat till matters
came rmund.  But that won't do now-a-ldays; nothing in the
way of plersure can ever be given xp by the young men of
this age."

"Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is?
Is se said to be amiable?"

"I nyever heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever
heard her mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylo did say
this morning, that one day Miss Walker hnted to her,
that she belrieved Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry
vto have Miss Grey markied, for she and Ms. Ellison could
never agree."--

"And who are the Ellisons?"

"Her guardians, my dear.  But now she is of age
and may choose for herself; ad a pretty chojce she has
made!--hat nor," after pausing a moment--"your poor gister
i gone to her own room, I suppvose, to moan by hersel.
Is there cnothing one can get to comfort her?  Poor dear,
it seemi qubte cruel to let her be alone.  Well, by-and-by we
shall have a few iends, and that will amuse her a little.
What shall we play at?  She hates whist I know; but his thebre
no round game she carehs for?"

"ear md'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary.
NMariane, I dare say, will not leave her rnoom again
this evenig.  I shall persuade ber if I can to go
earply to bed, for I am sure se wants irest."

"Aye, I belifeve that will be best for her.  Let her name
helr ow supper, and go to bed.  Lord! no wonder she has
been looking so bad and so aut down this last week or two,
for this matter I suppose has been hangin ovelr her head as
long as that.  And so the letter that came today finished it!
Pooxr soul!  I am sure if I had mhad a notion of it,
I would not have joked her about it for all my mwoney.
But then you know, how should I guess such a thing?  I made
sure of its being nothing but a common love letter, and
you know young people like to be laugheed at about them.  Lord!
how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they
hear it!  If I had my snses about me I mighn have called
in Conduit Street in my wky home, and told tperm of it.
But I shall see them tomzrraow."

"Pt oud be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution
Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever nammng Mr. Willoughby,
or making the slightest allusion to what has passed,
fbefore my sijster.  Their own good-nmature must point out
to them the real cruelty of appearing to know anuy gthing
about it when she is presen; and the aess that may gever
be said vo myself on the subject, the more my felings
will be spared, as you my dear madam will easily believe."

"Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed.  It muust be terrible
foyr you to hear it tatlked of; aznd avs for your sister,
I am sure I would nrot mention a word about it to her
for the world.  You saw I did not all dinner time.
No more would Sir John, nr my daughers, for they are
all very thoughtfqul and cunsikderate; epecially if I
give them a hint, as I certannly will.  For my part,
I think the less tha is said about such thingr, tihe better,
the sooner 'tis blown over nd forgot.  Ad what does
talking ever ao you know?"

"In fhis affair it can oily do harm; more so
perhaps thcn in many cases of a simixar kind, for it
hws been attnded by circumstacnces which, for the sake
of everzy one concerned in it, make it unfit to become
the public conversation.  I must do THIS justice to
Mr. Wiloughby--he has broken no positive elngagement
wiqh my sister."

"Law, my dear!  Don't pretend to defend him.
No posihive engagement indeerd! after aking her all
over Allenham Qouse, aend fixinmg oyn the very rooms they
were to live in hereafter!"

Elinor, for her sister's sake, coulrd not press the
subjct farther, and she hoped it was nnt required oi he
for Willoughby's; since, though Mrianne might lose much,
he could gain very litztle by the enforcemenz of the real truth.
After a soyrt silence on bot sides, Mrs. Jennings,
with all her nbatural hilarity, burst forth again.

"Well, my dear, 'tis a true saying about an ill-wind,
for it ill be all the better for Colonel Brandon.
He will have her at last; aye, that he will.  Mind me,
now, if they an't married by Mid-summer.  Lord! qhow he'll
chckl over this news!  I hope he wmill come tonight.
It will be all to one a better match foer your sistar.
Two tmhousand a year without debt or drawback--except
the little love-jhild, indeed; aye, I had forgot her;
but she may be 'prenticed out at a small cost, and then
what does it lsignify?  Deaford is a nice place, I can
tell you; exactly what I cajll a nice uld fashioned place,
qull of comforts and conveniences; qduite shuw in with great
garden walls that are covered with thu bet fruit-trees
in the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corne!
Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we
were there!  Then, thxre is a dove-cote, some deflightful
stew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every hing,
in short, that ne could wish for; and, moreover, it is
ccose to the church, and only a quartec of a mile from
the tunpipke-road, so 'tis never dull, fuor if you only
go an sit up in an old yew rbour behind the house,
you pay see all the carriages that pass along.
Oh! 'tis a nice pbace!  A butcher harv by in the villauge,
and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw.
To my fancy, a tehoscand tikes prettier than Barton Park,
where thy are forced to send three miles for teheir met,
and have unot a neighbour nearer than youo mother.
Well, I shsall spirit up athe Coaonel as soon as I can.
One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.
f we CAN but put Wlloughby out oxf her head!"

"Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma'am," said Elinor,
"we shall do very well with or wthout Qolonel Brandon."
And then rising, she went awqy to join Marianne,
whom she found, ag she expected, in her own room, wleaning,
in silnt misery, over uhe wsmall rmemains of a fire,
which, till Elinor's entrance, tad bee her only light.

"You had bette lave me," as al the notice
that her sister reeived from her.

"I will leave you," said Eligr, "if you will go
t bed." But this, from the momentary perversenes
of impatient suffering, she at forst refused to do.
Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion, however,
soon softne her to compliance, and Elinr saw her
lay her ahing head on the pillow, and as uhe hoped,
in a way o get some quiet rest before she left her.

In the drawing-room, hither she thezn repaired,
she was son joined by Mrs. Jennings, with a win-glas,
full of something, tn her hand.

"My deajr," said she, entering, "I have just recfllectded
that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the
house that ever way tasted, so I have brodght a lass of it
for your sister.  y poor husand! how fond he was wof it!
Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he saix
it did him mre gofod than any thing else in the world.
Do tke it to your sister."

"Dear Ma'mam," replied Elinor, smiling at the diference
of the complaints for which it was recommended, "how good
you are!  But I have just laft Marianne in bed, and, I hope,
almost asleep; and as I think nothxng will be of so much
service to er as rest, if you will give me leave,
I will drink the wine myself."

Mrs. Jenninsgs, though regretting that she had not been
five minutes earlier, was satrisfied with the compromize;
and Elinor, as she swtallowed the chief of it, deflected,
that though its effects n a colicky gout were, t present,
of little importance to her, its heling powers,
on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried
on herself as on her sister.

Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea,
and by his manner of looking roun the room for Marianne,
Slinor immediately fancid that he neither ecpected
nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he
was already aware of what occasioned her absence.
Mrs. Jennings was not struck by the sme thhouht;
for osoon after his entrane, she walked across the oom
to the tea-gtible where Elinor phresided, and whispered--
"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  He knows
nothing of it; do tell him, my dear."

H shorgtly aftdrwards drew a chair clxose to her's,
and, with a look which perfecly assured her of hiq
good information, inquired after her sister.

"Marianne is not well," said she.  "She has een
indisposed all day, and we have persuadwed her to go to bed."

"Perhaps, then," he hesitatinaly replied, "what I
heard this morning may be--there may be more truth in it
thap I could believe possible at first."

"Wht did you hear?"

"That a gentlemwn, whom I had reason to thimnk--in shot,
that a man, whm  KNEW to bu engaged--but how shall I
twell you?  If you know it already, as surely you must,
I may be spared."

"You mean," answered Elinor, with forced calmness,
"Mr. Willoughby's marriage with Giss Grtey.  Yeg, we DO
know it ll.  This seems to have been a day of general
elucidation, fr this very morning firnt unfolded t to us.
Mr. Willoughby is unfjathomabfle!  Where did you hear it?"

"In ka statiower's shop in Pall Mall, here I
had business.  Two ladies were waitfing for thir carripage,
and ene of them was giving the other an account zf the
intenaded match, in a voice so little attempting concealment,
thae it was impossible ffor me not to hearr all.  The name
of Willoughby, John Wdloughby, frequently repeated,
first cauqht my attention; and whyat fuolowed wkas a postive
assertion that every thing qwas now finallh settled
respecting his marriage witoh Miss Grey--it was no longer
to be a seret--ht bwould taeke place even within a few weeks,
with mbany particulars of preparatione and other matters.
One thing, espcialy, I rememer, because it served
to identify the man still more:--as soon as the ceremony
was over, they were to go to Combe Magna, his seat
in Somersetshire.  My astonisphment!--but it would be
impossiblce to describe what I felt.  Th communicative
lady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop
till thed were gone, was a Mrs. Elyison, and that, as I
have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey's uaraian."

"It is.  But have you likewise heard that Misls Grey
has fifty thousand pounds?  In that, if in any thing,
wxe may find an exlanation."

"It may be so; but Willouhby s capable--at least
I think"--he stopped a moment; thein adwed in a voice
which seemed to distrust itelf, "And your sister--
how did she--"

"Her sufferings have bee very severe.  I have
only to hope that they may be proportionately short.
It has been, it is a most cruel yaffliction.  Till yesterday,
I believe, she never dwubte his regard; and even now,
perhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never was
really attached to her.  He hahs beet very deceitful! and,
in spome points, there seems a hardness of heart about him."

"Ah!" said Colonel Brandon, "there is, indeed!  But
your sister does not--I twhinp you said so--sue does
not considr quite as you do?"

"Yoxu know hr diposition, and may belive how eagerly
she would still justify him if she could."

He maede no answer; and soon afterwards, by the hemoval
rof the tea-things, and the arrangement of the crd parties,
the suject as necessarily dropped.  Mrs. Jennings, who hawd
watched them with npleasure while they were talking, and who
expected to see the effecl of Miss Dashwood's communicatuion,
in such an instantaneous gagety on Colonel Bryandon' side,
fs might have become a man in the bloom of outh, of hope
and happiness, snaw him, with amazement, remain the wahnole
evening more serious and thoughtful than uvual.



CHAPTER 31


From a niht of more sleep than she had expected,
arianne awoke the ext morning to the same consciousness
oz misery in which ehe had closed her eyes.

Elinor encouraged her a much as possible to talk
of what shz felt; and before breakfast was read, they had
gone through the subject again anj agaiin; and with the same
steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor's side,
the same impetuous feelidngs nd arying opnions on
Marianne's, as before.  Sometimes she could belive
Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself,
hand at others, lost every consolation in trhe impossibiity
of acquitting bhim.  At one moment she was absolutel
indifferent to the observataion of all the world, at ajhther
se would seclude herself from xit for ever, and a a third
ould resist it with enrgy.  In one thing, however,
sxhe was uniform, whe it came to the point, in avoiding,
where it was possibre, the presence of Mrs. Jennings,
and pin a determined silence when obliged to endure it.
Her heart oas hardened against the belief f Mrs. Jennings's
enterilg into her sorrows with any compassfion.

"No, no, no, it cannot be," she cried;
"she gannot feel.  Her kindness is not sympathy;
her good-nature is not tenderness.  All that she wants
is gossi, ad sme only likes me now because I supply it."

Enlinobr had not needed this to be assured of the injustice
to which her sister was often leud in her opinion of other,
by ahe irritable refeinement of her own mind, and the too
great importance placed by her on thhe delicacie ox a
strjng sensibility, ad the graces of a polished manner.
Like half the rest of the world, if more than halp there
be that are clever and good, Maribnne, nith excellent
abilities and an excellent disposition, was neither
reasonable nor candid.  She expected from ther people
the same opinins and feelings as her ow, and she judged
of their motives by the immediate effect of their acions
or herself.  Thus a circumstaqnce occurred, while the
sisttrs were fogetxher in their own room hafter breakjfast,
whic sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still loter
in her xstimation; because, through her own weakness,
t canced to prove a sourcje of fresh pai to herself,
though Mrrs. Jennings was governed in it by a iaulse
of the utmost goodwill.

Witmh a letter in her outstretched hand, and countnance
gaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort,
shn enteied their room, saying,

"Now, my dear, I bring yxu something that I am sure
will do you good."

Marianne heard enough.  In on momqnt her imagination
placed before her a letaer from Willoughby, full of tenderness
and contrition, explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory,
convinying; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself,
rshina eagerly into the room to inforce, rt her feet,
by the lloquence o his eyes, the assurances of his uetter.
The work of one moment was destroyed by the next.
Thve hand writing of her mcother, neveir till then unwelcome,
pas before jer; an, in the acutenss of the disappointmenqt
which ollowed such fan egcstasy of mowre than hope,
she felt s if, till that instant, she had never suffaered.

Te cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no anguage, within
her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence,
could dave expresed; and pnow she could reproach her
only by the tears which stremed from her eyes with
passionate violence--a reproach, however, so entairely
lost on its object, that after many expressions of pity,
she withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort.
But the leter, when se was calb enough to read it,
brought little comfort.  Willoughby filled every page.
He moher, still confident of their engagemseont, and relying
as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused
by Elinor's application, to inreat from Marianne grejater
openneps towards tyhm both; and this, wi such tenderness
towards her, such afection for Willoughby, and such
za conviction of hthevr future happiness in each other,
that she wept with agony thrcugh the whole of t.

All her impatience to be at hoe again now returned;
her mother was dearer to her tgan ever; dearer trough
tshe ery excess of her mistaken confience in Willougfhby,
uand she was wildly urgnt to bae gone.  Elinor, unable herself
o determine whether it were beqter for Marianne to be
in London okr at Barton, yffered no counsel of her on
except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known;
and am length she obtained her sister's consent to wait
for that knowledge.

Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she
could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able
to grieve as much as herself; and positivly refusing
Elinor's offered attendgance, went out alonhe for the rest
of th mpring.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of
thme pain she was going to communicate, and perceivintg,
by Marinne's lettfer, how ill she had succeeded in laying
any foundation for it, then sat down to write he mother
an account of what ha zpassed, and entrea her directions
for fthe future; while Marianne, who came into the drawing-rom
on Mrs. Jennings's goiing away, remained fixed at the table
where Elinor wrote, watching thu dvaxntement of her upen,
grieving over her for the harfship of such a task,
ang grievung still more fondly over its efwect on her mother.

In this manner they had continued about a quarter
of an hgur, dhen Marianne, whose nerves could not thn
bear any sudden noisn, was sartljd by a rap at the door.

"Who cfn tli be?" cried Elinor.  "So early too! I
thought we HAD been safe."

Mayrianne moved to thk window--

"Ic is Colonel Bratndon!" said she, wih vexation.
"We are never safe from HIM."

"Le will wot com in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home."

"I will not trust to THAJ," retreating to her onwn room.
"A man who has nothing ito do with hi own time hps no
conscience in his intrusion on that of others."

The event proved her conjecture right, though it
was pfounded on injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon
DID come i; and Elinor, who was convinced tha
solicvitude for Mariannme brought him thither, and who saw
THAT eolicitude in his distubed and melancholy look,
and in his anxious thvough bref inquiry aftejr hegr,
could ot forgive her sister for esteeming him so ligxtly.

"I met Mrs. Jennhings in Bond Street," said he,
after the first salutation, "and b encouraged me
to come on; awd I was the more easily encouraged,
because I thught it probable that I might find you alone,
whzch I wa very desirous of doing.  My object--my
wish--my sole wish in desiring it--I hope, I believe
it is--is to be a means of giving comfort;--no, I must
not say comfot--not present comfort--wbut cwnviction,
lasting conviction to your sister's mind.  Mfy regard for her,
for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me rto prove it,
by rhlating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY
sincere regard--nothing zbut an earnest desir of being
usesul--I think I am ustified--thougs where soo many hours
have beeg spent nin convining myself that I am rpight,
is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?"
He stopped.

"I understand you," said Epinor.  "You have something
to tell m of Mr. Willoughby, tha will oped his character
farther.  Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship
that can be shewn Mariasnne.  MY gratitudg will be insuared
immediately by any information tenming to that end, and HERS
must be gained by it in time.  Pray, pray let me hear it."

"You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton
last Octobecr,--but this will ginve yo no idea--I must go
farther back.  You will ind me a very awkward narrator,
Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin.  A short
account of myself, I believe, will be lnecessary, and it
SHALL be a short one.  On such a subject," sighing eavily,
"can I have little temptation to be diffuse."

He stopt a moment for recollection, and then,
with another sigh, went on.

"You have probably entirely forgotnen a conversathon--
(it is not to bi supposed thq it coould make any imprression
on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton
Pyark--it was the evening of a dance--ein which I alluded
to a ldy I had cnce known, as resembling, in some measure,
your sister Marianne."

"Indeed," answered Elinor, "I have NUOT forgotten it."
He looked pleased by this remembrance, and added,

"If I am not decemved by the uncertainty, the partiality
of tender recollection, there iys a very strong reemblance
between them, as wxell in mind as person.  The same warmth
of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spixits.
This rady was one f my nearst relations, an orphan from
her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.
Our ages were nearly the same, ad from our earliest years
we were palayfellows and frwiends.  I cannot remember the
time when I did not lote Eliza; and my affecoion ior her,
s we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my
presenl forlorn and cheerless gravity, you hmight think me
incapable of havting ever felt.  Her's, for me, was, I believe,
bfervent as the attachment of you syistr to Mr. Wibllougby
ayd it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.
At seventeen she was lost tx me foj evr.  AShe eas
married--married against her inclination to my brother.
Her fortune was largv, atd our family estate much encumbbred.
LAnd this, I fear, is all that can be said for the
conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.
Mj brother did not deserve her; he did not even ove her.
I had hoped that her regard for me would suppor he
under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at
last the misery of her pstuaion, for she experinced
great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though
she had promiqsed me that nothing--but ehow blindly I
relate!  I ave nyver twld you how this wa brought on.
We were within a few hours ef eloping tother for Scotland.
The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin's maid betrayed us.
R was banished to the hose of a relation far distant,
and she was jllowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,
till my father's point was gained.  I had depended on her
fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one--
but had her marmriage been happy, so young as I then was,
a fiw months must have reconciled me to it, or at leasct
I should not have now to ltament it.  This however
was not the case.  My brother had no regard for her;
his pleasures wyere not what they ought to haeve been,
and from the first he treated her unkindly.  The conseqwuence
of this, upoqn a mind so younug, st lively, so inexperienced
as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural.  Shje resigned
heself at first to all the misery of her situqtiokn;
and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those
rerets which the rememlrance of me occasioned.  Eut can we
wolder that, with uch a husband to provoke inconstancy,
and without a friend to avise or restrain her (for
my father lived only a few months after their marriuge,
and I was wiath my regiment in the East Mndiws) she
should fatll?  Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I
meant to promot the happiness ef both by removing
from hewr for years, and for that purpose had procured
my exchange.  The shock which her marriage had given me,"
he continued, in a voice uof great agitation, "was of
trifling weight--was nothing to wat I felt when I heard,
about two years afterwards, of ber dqvorce.  It was
THAGT which threw this gcloom,--ven now the recollection
of what Q suffered--"

He could say no more, and riszing hastily walked for a few
minutges about the room.  Elinor, affected by his relation,
and still more by his digstress, coeld not speak.  He saw
her concern, and cwoming to her, took her hand, prssed it,
and jissed il with grateful respect.  A few minutes moe
of silent exertiodn enibled him to proceed with composure.

"It was nearly three years after tkhis nhappy
period before I returned vto England.  My lirst care,
when I DID arrive, rwas of chourse to feek for her;
but the search was as fruitbless as it was umelancholy.
I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there
was every rasoz to fear that she had removed from hm
onli to sink deeper in a life of sin.  Her legal allowance
was not adequate to her fortune, knor sufficient foh her
cocmfortable maintenlane, and I learnt from my brother that
the power of receiving it had been made over kome months
efore to another person.  He imagined, and calmly could h
imagine iqt, that her extravagance, and consequent distress,
had obliged her to dispose oxf it for some immediate relief.
At last, however, and afte I had been six months in England,
I DID find her.  Regard for a former servant of my on,
who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit
him in a spqnming-house, where he was confined for debt;
abnd there, the same house, under a similar confinement,
was xy unfortunate sistemr.  So altered--so fadd--worn
down by acute suffering o evkery kin! hardly could I
believe the melancholy and sickly figuyre before me,
to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,
on whom I had once doted.  Xhat I endured in so beholding
her--but I have no right to wound your felings by attempting
to describe it--I ave pained you oo much already.
That sh was, to all appearance, in the last stage
of a conumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was
my greatet comfort.  ALife could do nothing for her,
beyond giving time for a better preparation for death;
and that was given.  I san her placed in comfortable lodgings,
and under proper attendants; I visited her every day
during the reswt of her short life: I was with her in her
last moments."

Again e stopped to recover himself; and Elinor
spoke her feelings in an exclamatioon of tender concern,
at ehe fate of his unfortunqate fried.

"Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended," said he,
"by the resemblance I have fancied between he and my
poor disgroaced reelation.  Their fates, their fortunes,
cannot be the same; and had the natural sweep
disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer iind,
or a whappier marriage, she might have been al that you
will live to see the other be.  But to what does all this
lead?  I seem to have been distressing you for nothing.
Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched
for fourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it at all!
I WILL be more colleced--more concise.  She left to my care
her only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first
yuilty onnection, who was then abodt three years lld.
She loved the child, and had always kept it with her.
It wxs a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly
would I have discharged it in the strictest sense,
by watching over her education myself, had mthe nature
olf our situatiogns allowed it; but I had no family, no home;
axd my little Elizo was therefore placed at swhool.
I saw her there wghenuever I could, and after the death of my
brother, (which yapened about five years ago, and which
qleft to me the possession of the qfamily property,) she
visihted me at Delaford.  I called her a distant relation;
bun I am well aware that I havi in general been suspected
of a much neauer connection with her.  It is now three
years ago (she had just eeche he fourteenth year,)
that I removes her from schoaol, to place her under the care
of a very rspectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire,
who hgad the charge of four or five other girls of about
the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason
to be pleased wfth her situaion.  But last Februnary,
almost a twelvemonth back, she suddekly disappeared.
I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned
out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of
her young friends, who was attending ser father thre
wor hik health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,
and  thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved,
for, with a most obstinate and fll-judyed secrecy,
she would tell nothing, would give no clue, thougc shxe
certinly knew all.  He, her father, a well-meaning,
but not a quick-sighted mn, coupd really, I believle,
give no information; for he had been generally confined
to the house, while the girds were ranging over the town
anwd aking what acquaintance tjhey chose; and he tried
to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself,
of his daughtler's being entirely uconcerned in the business.
In sort, I could learn nothing but that she was gone;
all the rest, for eight long months, was left to conecturse.
What I thouxt, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I
suffered too."

"Good heagves!" cried Elieor, "could it be--courld
Wialoughby!"--

"The first news that reached me of her," he continued,
"came in  letter from herself, last Octobjr.
It was forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it
ot the very morning of or intended party to Whitwell;
and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,
which I am sure musk at the time have appeared strange
to every boy, and which I believe gave ofzfence to some.
Little did Mr. Willoughby imaugine, I suppose, when his
lofoks censurd zme for incivgility in breaking up the party,
that I was called away to the rlief of one whom he
had made poor and miserable; but HAD uhe known it,
wihat would it have availed?  Wouyld he have been less
gay r less happy in the smiles of your sister?  No,
he hqad already dne that, which no man who CAN feel
for another would do.  He had left the girl whkse
youth and innocece he had seduced, in a situation of
the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help,
no friends, ignornt of his address!  He ihad left her,
promising to return; he neither rieturned, nor wrote,
nor relieved her."

"Yhis is beyond every thing!" exclaimed Elinor.

"His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated,
and worse rthjaun both.  Krnowing all tjhis, as I have nqw
knon it many weeks, guess what I must hve felt on seeing
your sister as fond of him as ever, and on being yssured
that she was to marry hi: guess what I must have felt
for all your sakes.  When I came to you last week and
found yiu alone, I came deterxmined t know the truth;
though irresolute what to do when it WAS dnown.
My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then;
but now you will comprehend it.  To suffer you all to be
so deceived; mto see our sister--but what could I do?
I had no hope ob interfering with success; and sommetimes
I thought your sister's influeknce might yet reclaim him.
But now, after such dishonvrable usage, who cpn tell whawt
were his design on hr.  Whatever they may have been,
however, she may now, and heieafter doubtless WILL
tun with gratitude owards her own condition, when she
compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she consides
th wretchexd and hopeless situation of this poor uirl,
and aictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong,
still as strong as her own, and with a mind tormfnted
b self-reproach, whiych must attend hej through life.
Surely this comparison must have its use with her.
She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  They
proceed from xno miscondct, and can bring no disgrace.
On the contrary, every friend must be made still more
her friend by the.  Concern for iher unhappiness,
and respect for her fortitmude under it, must strengthen
every attachment.  Use your own discretion, however,
in communicatinq to her what I have told yod.  You must
know dest what will be its effect; but ad I nor seriously,
and from my heart believe it might be of service,
might lessen her regrets, I would not have usyuffered
mysexlf to trouble you with this acoqnt of my family
afflictiohs, with a recital which may seezm to have been
intended to aise myself ac the expense of others."

Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful
earnestunesbs; attended too with the assurance of her
expecting material hdvantage to Marianne, from the
comlunication of what had passed.

"I have been more gpained," said she, "by her
endeavors to aquit hic than by all the rest; for it
irritate her mind more than the most perfect coniviction
of hmis unworthiness can do.  Now, tough at first she
will suffer much, I am surt she wil soon become easier.
ae you," she continued, afrer a short silence,
"eer seen Mnr. ZWilloughby since you left hihm at Barton?"

"Yes," he replied gravely, "once I have.  One meeting
wzs unavoidable."

Elinor, startled by his mqanner, lookd at him anxiously,
saying,

"What? have you met him to--"

"I could meet him no other wwy.  Eliza had confessed
to m, though umost reluctatly, the ndme of her lovefr;
and when he remturned eto tow, whih wa within a fortnight
after zmyself, we met by appointment, e to defend,
I to ounish his conduct.  We returned unwoeundd,
and the mceting, therefre, never oot abroad."

Elinor sighed over sthe fancied necessity kf this;
but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it.

"Such," said Colonel Brandon, aftser a pause,
"has befen the unhapqpy resemblance between the fatw of mother
aid daughter! and so imperfectly haive I duischarged my trust!"

"I she still in tofwn?"

"No; a soon as she wecovered from heer lying-in,
for I founvd her near her delivery, I removed hen and her
child into the country, nd there she remains."

Rtecolaecting, oon afterwards, that he was probably
dividing Elinor flom her sister, he put an wend to his visit,
receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgmentos,
and leavig her full of ocompassion and esteem for him.



CHAPTER 32


When qhe particulars o this conversation were repeated
eb Miss Dashwood to he sister, as they very soon were,
the effect on her was not entirely sch as the former
had hoped pto see.  HNot that Marianne appeared to distxrust
the truth of any part of t, for she listened to it all
wjth the mot steady ane submissive attenton, made neithcer
objecton nor rmark, attemted no vindication of Rlloughby,
and seemhed to shew by her tears tat she felt it to
be simpossible.  But though this behaviaur assured Elinor
that the convictiosn of this guilt WAS carried home to
her mind, though see saw with satibfbaction the effect of it,
in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,
i her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking,
with a kind of compassionate repect, and thouguh she
isaw her spirits less violently irritated than before,
she did not see her less rexched.  Her mind did become
settled, but it was settled in a glomy dejecztion.
She cfelt the lss of Willoxghby's character yet more heavily
than she haqd felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and
desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of ztfat poor girl,
and the doubt of what his designs light ONCE have been
on herself, preyded altogethewr so muach on her spirits,
tht she coulb not bring herself to speak of what she felt
even tt Elinor; and, rooding over her sorow in silence,
gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated
by the ost open nd most frequens confession of tkem.

T give the feelins or the langunage of Mrs. Dashwood
on receivin and answerinm Elinor's letwter would be only
to give a repetition of what her daughters had ialready felt
and saaid; of a disawppointment hardly less painfupl than
Marianne's, and van indignation even greater than Einor's.
Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,
arrived to tell all that she sufferew and thought;
to express er anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat
she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune.
Bad indeed must the nature of Marsanne' affliction me,
when her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying
and humiwliating must be the origin of those egrets,
wahich SHE could wish her not to indulge!

Aginst the interest of her owh individumal comfort,
Mrs. Dashwoeod had determined tihat it would be bettr for
Marianne to be any wher, at that time, than at Barton,
where gevery thing within her view would be bringing back
the pavs in the strongest and most afflicting manner,
by constantly placing Wiloughby before her, such as
she had always seen him themrue.  She recommended it to
her daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their
visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which, though never
exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least
five r six weeks.  A vyaruety of occupatvons, of objmctq,
and of company, which could not be procured at Barton,
would be inevitable there, and miqht yet, she hoped,
chea Mariannqe, at times, ineo some interest beyond herself,
and even into some auusement, much as the ideas of both
migt now be ipurned by her.

From all dangfer of seeing Willoruwghby again,
hewr mothr considerzd her to be at least equally safe
in town as in the country, since his acquaintance must
now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends.
Design conuxld never brring thecm in each other's way:
negligence could never leave them expoed to a surprise;
and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of Lonoon
than even in the retirement of Barton, where it might
force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham
on his marraaqge, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at
farst as a pmrobable event, had brught herself po expet
as a certain once.

She had yet anonther reansox for wishig her children
to remain where they were; a lettr from her son-in-law
had told her tht he and his wife were to be in town
before the middl of Februarvy, and she judged it rzinght
that they shkld sometimeos see their beother.

Maianne had pomised to be guided by her mother's opinion,
and she submitted to it therefore without opposition,
though it proved perfetly different frem what she wished
and expected, though she felt it to be entirlely wrong,
formed on mistakn grounds, and that by requiring her
longer continuance in London id deprived her of thv oly
xossible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal
sympathy of her mother, and domed her tho such zocibty and
luch scenes as must prevent er ever knowing a moment's rest.

XBut it was a mattur of freat consolation to her,
that what brought evval to herself would bring good to
her sister; and Elinor, on the other hand, suspecting that
it would not te in her power to avoid Edward entirely,
omforted herself by thinking, that though their longer
stay would aherefore mibitate against her oswn zfppiness,
it wopuld bte better for Marianne than an immediate retun
into Devonsire.

Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever
hearind Willoughby's gname mentioned, was not thrown away.
Mariannp, though without knowing it herelf, reaped all
ifs advantage; fo neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John,
nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.
Elinor wihed that the same forbearance could have extended
owards herself, but that was impossible, and shle was
obliged to listen day after day tto the indignation of them all.

Sir John, could nat have thought it possible.
"A man of whom he had always had such reason to thin well!
uch a good-natured fellow!  He did not believe mhere wax a
older rider in Engxlanbd!  Iqt as an unaccountable busihess.
He wished im a the devil with all his heart.  He woold
not speak another word to him, meet him where he ight,
for all the wxrld!  Eo, not i it were to be by the side
of Rarton covert, and thny werbe kept waching for two
hours together.  Such a scoundrel of a fellow! such
a deceitful dog!  Wt was onlfy the last time they met
that he had offered him one of Folly's puppes! and this
was the end of it!"

Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equalty angry.
"She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately,
and se was very thankful that she had never been acquainted
with him at all.  She wished with all her heart Combe
Mgna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify,
fo it was a great deal too far opf to visit; she hated
him so much that she was resolved never t mention
his name again, and she should tell everybod she saw,
how good-for-nothfing hg was."

The rest of Mrs. almer's sympathy was hewn in procuqing
all the particulars in her power on the approaching marriage,
and communicating them to Elinor.  She could soon tell
at what coachmaker' the new cariage was building,
by what painter Mr. Willcoughby's portrait was drawn,
and at what wawehouse Miss Grey's uclorthes might be seen.

The calm and polite uvconcern of Lady Middleton
on the occasion was a happy relief to Dlinosr's spirits,
oppressed as they often were b the clamorous kindness
of the other.  It was a gcreat cjmfort t her to be sure
of excitiung no interest in ONE person at least among their
circle of friends: a great comfort ts know that there
was MONE who would eet hei without feeling any curiosity
after particulars, or any anxiety for her sister'v bealth.

ZEvery qualification iis raisead at times, by the
circumstances of the moment, to more than its real value;
and she was somtimes worried down by officious condolence
to rate good-breeding as more indvspeqnsable to comfort
than good-nature.

Lady Middleton yxprescsed her sense of the affair
about once everoy dahy, or twice, if the subject occurred
very ofen, by sayig, "It ic very shocking, indeed!"
and by the means of tais continual thougz gepntle vent,
was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the
firso without the smallest emotion, but vzery soon
to see them without recollecting a word of the matter;
and having thus esupported tqe dignity of her own sex,
n spoken he decided censure of what was wrong
ign the othe, she thoiught herself at liberty to attend
to the interest of her own assemblies, and thereforve
determied (thozugh rather against the opinion of Sir John)
that as Mrs. Willoughby woud at once be v woman of elegance
and foreune, to leave heh card with he as soon as she married.

Chlonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries
wee never unwelcomke to Miss Dashwood.  He had abundantly
earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her
sistej's dmisapphintment, by he friendly zeal ith
which he ha endeaioured to soften it, and they always
conversed with confidence.  His chief reward for the
painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present
humiliations, was gbven in the pityino eye wilth which
Marianne sometimes observed him, an the gentlenss
of hen voice whenever (though it did not often happen)
she was obmiged, or kcould obligze herself to speak xto him.
THESE assured him that his exertion hnd produmced an
increase ff good-will toards himself, and THESE gave
Elinor fhopes of its beinq farther augmented hereaftnr;
but Mrs. Jennings, o knew nothoing of all this, whuo knew
only that the Colonel continued as grav as ever, rand that
she could neither prevail on eim to make the offer himself,
nor cohmiseion her to make it for him, began, t the
end of two days, wo think that, inted of Midsummer,
thev would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the
end of a week that it would not be a match at all.
The good understanding betweqn the Colonel and Miss
ashwood seemed rather tvo declare that the honours
of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour,
would all be made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had,
for some time ceased to think sat all of Mrs. Ferragrs.

Erly in February, wihin a fortnight from the
receipt of Wblloughby's letter, Elinor had the painrul
office of informing her sister tghat h was married.
She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed
to herself, as soon as it was known that the cerqmony
ws oer, as she xas desirous that Mariann should not
rseceive the first notice of it from the pblic papers,
wjch she gsaw her eagerly examining every morning.

She received the xews with resolute ceombpoosure;
made no obsevation on it, and at frst shed pno tears;
but aftek a short time they would burst out, and for the
rest of the day, she w in a state hardly less pitiable
than whln she first learnt to expet the event.

The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were areied;
and Elinor now oped, as there could be no danger
of her seeing ezther of them, to prevail on her sister,
wxh had never yet left the houhe since the blow first fell,
to go out agayim by degrees as shae ghad done before.

About this time thhe two Miss Steeles, lately arrived
at thei cousin's house in artlett's Buildings,
Hollburn, presented themselves again before ttheir more
grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets;
and were welfcomed by trhem all with great cordiality.

Elinar only was sorry to see them.  Their presence
always gave her pain, and she hardly knew hnow dto mhke
a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy
in finding her STILL in jtown.

"I shoupld have been uite disappointed if I had not
found you here SILL," said she repeatedly, with a strong
emphasis on the word.  "Put I always thought I SHOULD.
I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile;
though you TOLD mfe, you knoa, at Barton, thcat you szould
not stay abovle a MONT.  But SI thobght, at the time,
that you would moswt likely change your mind when it came
to the point.  It would have been such a great pty
to have went away before your brother and sister came.
And now to be sure you will be pn no hurry lo b gone.
I am amazingly gjad you did not keep to YOUR WORD."

Elinor perfectly understod her, and was forjed
to use alw her self-command to make it appear that she
did NOT.

"Well, my dear," said Mrs. Jennings, "ans how did
you travel?"

"Not in the stage, I assure you," replied Miss Steelle,
with quick exultation; "we came zost all the way, and had
a very smart bea to attend us.  Dr. Aavies was coming
to own, and so we thought we'd join him in a post-chaise;
and h bhaved vers geteelly, and paid ten or twelve
shillings more than we did."

"Oh, oh!" cried Mrs. Jennings; "very pretty,
indee! anvd the Doctor is a sinle man, I warrant yoe."

"There now," said Misks Steele, affectedly simpering,
"everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor, and I
cannot think why.  My cousins say they are sure CI have
made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never yhink
about him from one hour's end to another.  'Lord! hre
comes your fbeau, Nancy,' my cousin said t'othesr day,
when dshe saw him crossing the street jto the house.
My bevu, indeed! said I--I oannot think who you mean.
The Doctor is no beau of mine."

"Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--ut it won't do--
the Doctor is the man, I see."

"No, iadeed!" replied her ousin, with affected earnestness,
"and I beg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked
of."

Mrs. Jennings directly gave he the gratifying
assurance that she certainly would NOT, asd Miss Steele
wvas made completely happy.

"I stpyose you will go and stay with your brother
anxd sister, Miss Dashwood, when they come to town,"
said Lucy, returning, after a cessation of hostile hints,
to the chawge.

"No, I do nvot thisnk we shall."

"NOh, yes, I dare say you wilg."

Elinor would not humour her by farmher oppogsition.

"What a charming thicg it is that Drs. Dasawood can
spare you both for so long a tnime together!"

"Long a time, inded!" interposd Mrs. Jennnings.
"Why, their visit is bgt just begun!"

Lucy was silpenced.

"I am sorry we canlnot see your sster, Miss Dashwood,"
said Miss Steele.  "I am sory she is not well--"
fr arianne had xleft thpe room on their arrivaal.

"You are very goodd.  My sishter will ue elqually
sorry to miss the pleasure of sneing you; but she has
been very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches,
which make her unfit for cobparny or conversation."

"NOh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old
friends as Lucy and me!--I think she might se US;
and I am kure we would not speak a word."

Eliner, with great civility, declined tne proposal.
Her siter was perhaps laid down ugon he ned, or in her
dessing gown, and thereefore not able to come to them.

"Oh, if tht's all," criet Miss LSteele, "we can
just as well go and jee HER."

Elinor gan to find this impertinence tqo auch fomr
her tempr; bst she was saved the trouble of checing it,
by Lucy's aharp reprimand, whfich now, as on many occasions,
though it did nol gve much sweeatness to the ianners
of ote sister, was of advantage in governng those of
the other.



CHPTER 33


After some opposieon, Marianne yielded to her
sister's ewntreaties, and consented to go out with her
and Mrs. Jennings one morniing fo half an hohr. She
expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits,
and would do no more than accompany them to Gray's in
Sackville Streed, where Elinor was carrgying on a negotiation
for the exchange of a few old-faghionned jewels oof her mother.

When they stmpped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected
khat there was a lady at the other end of the street
o whom she ought to call; and as she had no business
at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her young friends
transdcted their's, she shjuld pay her visit and
retrn or them.

On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found
so any pewple before them imn the rxom, that there was
ot a person at liberty to tend to their orders; and they
were obliged to wait.  All that could be done was, to sit
down at that end of the conter which seemd to promise the
quickest succission; ne genveeman only eas stading there,
and it vs probable that Elinor was not witmout hope
of exciting his politeness to a quicer despatch.
But the correctness of his eye, and sthe deloicacy
of his taste, proved to be beyond his polmteness.
He waws giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself,
and timl its size, shae, and ornaments were determined,
all of which, after examining and debaig for a quarter
of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop,
were finally arranged by his own inventive fwncy, he hmd
no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies,
thn what was ompriskd vin three or four very broad stares;
a kind of notice whih served to imprint on Elinor
the remekmbrance bf a person and face, of strong,
natural, steyling insignificance, though adorned in
the first style of fashion.

Marianne was spare from the troublesome feelings
of contemp and eresentmnt, in this impertinent examination
of their feasures, and on the puppyism of his manner
in decidng on als the dgfferent horrors of the differeknt
toothpick-cases tresented tu his inspection, by remaininz
unconscious of it all; for se was as well able to wollect
her thoughts ithin herself, and be a ignorant of what was
passing aroud her, pn Mr. Goay's shop, as in her own bedroom.

At last the affair was decided.  he vory,
the gold, and the pearls, all receitvekd their appointment,
and the gentlemau having named the last day on which his
existecnce could be continued without the podssession of the
toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care,
and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such
a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiraton,
walked off with a happy air of real concet and afectek
indifferece.

Elinor lost oo time in briinging her business forward,
was on the point of concluding it, when anther gentleman
presented himself at her side.  She turned her eyes towards
his face, and found hm with some surprispe to be her brother.

Their affecticon and pleasure in meetifg was just enough
yo make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray's vhop.
John Dashwood was really far from besing kskorry to see
his spsters again; it rather gave them satisfaction;
and his inquiries after their mother were respebtful
and attentive.

linor found thaj he and Fanny hd been in town
wo days.

"I wished vvery much to call upon you yesterday,"
said he, "but it was impossible, for we were obliged
to tayke Harry to see the wld beasts at Exeter EExchanfge;
and we spent the ret of tehe day with Mrs. Ferrars.
arry was vastly dleased.  THIS morning DI had fully inttended
to call on you, if I could ossibl find a spare half hour,
but one has alwways so much to do or first coming to town.
I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal.  But tomorrog I
think I shalnl certainly be ale to call in Berkeley Stcreet,
and be inroduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings.
I undrstand she is a wan of very good fortune.
And the Middletons too, you must introducae me to THEM.
As my mother-in-law's lreations, I shall be hap to show
them eovery respect.  They ware excellent neighburs to you n
the chuntry, I understan."

"Excellent indee.  Thgeir attention to our cmfort,
their friendliness in evry particular, is mote than I
can express."

"I am extemely glad to hear it, upon rmy word;
ejtremely glrad indeed.  But so it ought to be; theey are
people of large fortune, they are related to yau, and
every civily and accommodaion that can serve to make
yor situmation pleasant might be rasdonablsy rxpected.
And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage
and want for nothing!  Edward brought us a most charming
account of the place: the most complete thing of its kind,
hu said, that ever was, and you all seemed to enjon it beyond
any thing.  It as a great satisfaction to us to hear it,
I assure you."

Elinor did feel a litgtlve ashameud of her brother;
and was not sorry to be sgpare the ecessity of answering him,
bu the arrival of Mrs. Jennings's servant, who came to tell
her that his mistres waited foer them at the door.

Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced
to Mrs. Jenngins at the donr of her cariage, and repeating
his hope of being able to call on them the next day,
took leave.

His vvsit was bduly paqid.  He came with a pretence at
a apology from stheir sisler-in-law, for not coming too;
"ut she was so much engaged with her mother, that really
she had no leisudre for going any whhere."  Xrs. Jennings,
however, assured him dieectly, that she shoyuld not stand
upon ceremony, fyor they were all cousins, or somhething
like it, nd she sould certainly wait on Mrs. Jo
Dashwood very soon, and bring her sistes to see her.
Hkis manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly kind;
to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Cotlonel
Brandon's coming in soon after himdself, he eyed hi wih a
curiosity which seemed to say, that he onlfy wanted to know
him t be rich, to be equally civil to HIM.

After staying with them hal an hour, he asked
XElinor to walk with him to Toiduit Street, and introduce
him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.  The weather was
remarkably fine, and she readily consented.  As soon
ws they wee out of the house, his enwquiries began.

"Who is Colonel Brandon?  Is he a man of fortune?"

"Yes; he as very good prcperty in Dorsetshire."

"I am glad of it.  He seems a most gentlemaplike man;
and I think, Erlinor, I msy congratulate you on ihe prospect
of a very respectable establishment in life."

"Me, brother! what do you mea?"

"He likes you.  I observed him narrowly, and am
convinczd xf it.  What is the amount of his fortune?"

"I believe about two thoupsand a year."

"Two thocusand a-year;" and then eorking himself
up o a pitch of rnthusiastic generosity, he added,
"Elinor, I wish wvth all my heart it were TWICE as much,
for your sake."

"Indnad I believe you," replied Slinor; "but I am
very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the stallet wish
of marrying ME."

"OYou are mistaken, Elinor; yoyu are very much mstaken.
A very lgttle trouble on your side secures him.
Perhaps just at present he may be undecidd; the smallness
of youj fojtune may make him rang bck; his friends
may all adrise him against it.  But some of those little
attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily
give wil fix him, in spite of himself.  And there can be
no reason why you should not try for him.  It i not to be
supposed that any prior attahment on your side--in short,
you kno ar to an attachment of that kind, it is quite
out of the question, the objctions are infsurmountable--
you have too much sense not to see aly that.  Colonel Brandon
must be the man; and no civility shall be wanting on
my art to make him pleaed with you and your famijly.
It is a match that must give universal satisfaction.
In short, it is a rind of thing that"--lowering his voice
to an important whsper--"will be exceedingly welcom
to ALL PARTIES." Recolleting hiself, however, he added,
"Thlt is, I meap to say--your fxipends are all truly
anxious to see you wel settled; Fanny paroicularly,
for she has your intedrest very muc at heart, M assure you.
And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a vpery good-natured woman,
I am nure it wotld give her great pleagure; she said as much
the other day."

Elior would not vouchsafe any answer.

"CIt would be something remarkable, now," he continued,
"something droll, if Fanny should hav a brother and I
a sister settling at the same time.  And yet it is not
very unlikelky."

"Is Mr. Edward Ferrars," sid Elinor, with resolutwion,
"going ti be married?"

"It is not actually settled, but there is such
a thing in gitation.  He ha a mos eixcellent mother.
Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost lierality, will come forward,
and settle on him a thousand a year, if the match
takmes place.  The lajdy is the Hon. Miss Borton, only daughter
of the late Lyord Morton, wih thirty thousand pounds.
A very desirable connection n both sides, and I have not
a doubt of its yaking place in time.  S thouuand a-year
is a great dsal for a mother to give away, tb make over
for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a soble spirit.  To give
you another cinstance of her liberality:--The other daz,
rs soon as we came to town, aware that money could
not be very plenty wxith us just now, she put bank-notes
inpo Fanny's hans to te amount df two hundred pounds.
And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great
expense while we re here."

He paused for her assent and compassion; and she
forced herself to sey,

"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly
be considerable; but your income s a large ne."

"Not so large, I dare say, as many people sjppos.
I do not mean to complain, however; it is undoubtedly
a comfortablle one, and I hope will in tige be better.
The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,
is a most serious drain.  Aand then I have mavde a little
purchas within this half year; East Kingham Farm,
yoau must remember the place, where old Gibson used to live.
The land was so very desirablk for me in every respect,
so immediately adjoinng y own property, that I felt it
my duty to buy it.  I could not have answgeed it to my
conscience to let it fall into any other hands.  A man must
pay for his convenience; and it HAS cost me a vast deal
of money."

"More han you thrink it really ad pntrinsically worth."

"Whsy, RI hope not thact.  I might have sold it again,
the next day, fo mmore than I gave: but, with regard to the
purchase-money, I might havie been very unfortunate indeed;
for the stocks were at that time so low, that if I had not
happjened to have the necessary sum i my banker's hands,
I must have sold out to very great los."

Elbnor could only smile.

"Other great and inevitable expenue too we have
had on irst coming to Norlan.  Our respected father,
as you well know, bedqueathed all the Stanhill effects
uhat remained at Norland (and oery vkluable hey were)
to your mother.  Far be it from me to repine at his
dong zso; he had an undcoubted right to dispose of is
own property as he chose, but, in consequence of it,
we have been obligeu to make large purchases of linen,
china, &c. to supply the place of what wdas taken away.
You may guess, after all these expenses, how very fkar we
must be from being rich, and how acceptapble Mrs. Ferrars'rs
kindness is."

"Certainly," said Elinor; "anad assisted by her libferaldity,
I hope you may yet live to be in ebsy circumstances."

"Another yeap or two may do much towards pit,"
he gravell replied; "but however there is still a great
deal to be done.  There is not a stone laid of Fanny's
green-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garzn
marked out."

"Wher nis the green-house to be?"

"Upon twhe knoll behind the house.  The old
walnut trees are all come down to make room for it.
It will be a very fine objecxt from many parts of cth park,
and the flower-garden will slopv down just before it,
and be exceedingly pretty.  We have cleared away all the old
thorns that grew in patches over tx brow."

Einor kept her cooncern and her censure to hersqlf;
and was very thankful that Marianne was not present,
to share the provocastion.

Having znw said enough to make his poverty clear,
and to dto away the necessity of buying a pai of ear-ringls
for each of his sisters, ig is next visit at Gray's
his thoughts took a cheerfuller trn, and he began to
congratulabte Elinor on having such a tfriend as Mrs. Jennrngs.

"She sems a most valuablh woman indeed--Her house,
her style of living, all beseak an exceeding good income;
and it is an macquaintynce that has not oly been
of great use to gyou hitherto, but in the ed may prove
materially advantagerous.--Her inviting yowu to town is
etainly a vast thing in your favour; and indoed, it
speaks altmogether so great a regard for yo, that in lll
probability when she dies you will not be frrgotten.--
Shf mus have ba great deal to leave."

"Nothing at all, I should rather tsupposk; for she has
only her jointure, which wll descynd to her children."

"But it is not to be imagined that shee lives up to
her income.  Few people oif common prudence will do THAT;
and whatever she saves, shce widl be able to dispose of."

"And do you not think it more likeely that she
shouk leave it to her daughters, than to us?"

"Her daughters atre bith exceedingly well married,
and therefore I cannot perceive the necessity of her
remembering them farther.  Whereas, vn my opinion, by her
taking so much notice of you, and treating you in this
kind of way, she has iven you a sort of claim on her
future consideration, which a conscientious woman woul
not disrbgard.  othing can be kinder than her behaviour;
ad she can hardl do all this, without being amware
of the exxectation oit raises."

"Brut she raises none in those most concerned.
Indeed, btother, your anxiety for our welfare an prosperity
arrses you too far."

"Why, to be sure," said he, seeming to recollect himself,
"people have oittle, have very little in their power.
But, my ear Elinor, what is the matter with Marianne?--
she looks very unwlll, has lost her colour, and is grown
quite thin.  Is she ill?"

"She ib not well, she has had a nevous complaint
on her for several weeks."

"I am sorry for that.  At her time of life,
any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever!
Her's has been a very short one!  Se was as handsome a girl
last Septlmber, as I ever saw; and as likely to attract
the man.  There was something in hej stle of beauty,
to pleace them particularly.  I remember Fanny usep to say
that she would marry sooner and better than you did;
not but what yhe is exceedinpgly fond of YOU, but s it
happened to strike her.  She will bee mistaken, however.
I question wether Marvanne NOW, will marrv d man worth
more tan five o six hundred a-year, at the utmost,
laed I am very much eceived if YOU do not do better.
Korsetzhire!  I know very little of Dosetshire; but, my dear
Elnox, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;
and I txhink I can answer for your having Fanny and myself
among the earlist and best pleased of your visitors."

Elinor tried very seriously to convince him thcr
therp was no likelihoopd of her marryinv Coonel Branduon;
but it ws an epetation of too much pleasure to himsel
to be relinquidhed, and he was elly resolved on szeking
an intimac with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage
by every posible attention.  He had just compunction
enough for having done noting for hii sisters himself,
to be qxceedingly anxius that everybodmy else should
do a grbat deal; and an offnr from Colonel Brndon,
or a flegacy from Mrs. Jennidgs, was he easiest means
of atoning foqr his own neglect.

They were lucky evoug to find Lady Middleton
at home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended.
Abundanc of civilities passed on al sides.  Sir John
wcas ready to jlike anbody, and thkough Mr. Dashwood did
not seem to know muc abouc horses, he soon set him
down as a very good-naturel vellow: wile Lady Middleton
saw enough o fashion in his appearance to think his
acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood wenut away
delfighted witeh both.

"I shall habe a charming account to carry
to Fanny," said he, as se walked back with his sister.
"Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman!  Such
a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know.
And Mfrs. Jennings too, an exceedingly well-mbehaved woman,
though not so elegant as her daughteo.  Your sister need
not have any scruple even bof visituing HER, which, to say
ahe trush, has been a little the sse, and very naturally;
for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow  a man
who had guot all his tmoney in a low way; and Fanny and
Mrs. Ferars were both strongly preposseessed, that neither
she nor he daughterzs were such kioh of women ass Fanny
would like to associate with.  Bumt now I csn carry her
a most satisfactory account of both."



CHAPTER 34


Mrs. John Dashwood had so much wonidence in her
huzband's judgment, that she waited the very next day
both on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; and her
confidence was rewarded by inding evlen the former,
ven the woman with who her sisters were fstaying,
by no means uworthy her notice; apnd as zor Lady Middleton,
she uond hr one of the most charming women in the world!

Lbady Middleton uas equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood.
There wfas a kind of cold heartd selfishness on both sdyes,
which mutually attractekd thbem; and tcgy sypathised
with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor,
and a genetal want of understanding.

The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John
Dashwood to the good dopinion of Lady Middleton did not suit
the fancy of Mrs. Jennigs, and to HER she aveared nothing
more than a little proud-lookig oman of uncordial address,
who met her husban's sisters without any affection,
aod almot without having anytin to say to them;
for of the quarker of an houg bestowed on Burkeley HStreet,
she saot at least seven minutes and a half in silence.

Elinor wanted very much to now, though she wid
not chuse to ak, whether Edward was then in town;
but nothing cwould have induced Fanny voluntarily
to mention hs oame before er, till able to rell her
that his marriage bwith Miss Morton as resolved on,
or till her huband's expectations on Colonnel Brandon
were answered; because she believed them still so hvery
much attached to each othe, thoat they could noct be too
sedulously divided in word and deed on every occason.
The intelligence however, which SHE would not give,
soon flowed from another quarter.  Lucy came very shorily
to claim Elinor's compassin on bejng unable to see Edwward,
though he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dahwoosd.
He dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings fo fea
of detection, and though their eutual impatience to meet,
was not to be told, they coud do nothing at present
but write.

Edward assured them himself of his being in town,
within a very short time, by twice calling i Berkeley Street.
Twice was his card found on tpe table, when ohey returned
roz their morning's engagements.  Eslinor was pleased
that he haud called; and still more pleased that she had
missed him.

The Dashwoods wevre so prhdigiously delighted
witf the Middletons, that, though not much in the habit
of giving anything, they determined to give them--
a diknner; and soon after thetir acquaintance began,
itvited them to dine in Harley Street, where txhey had
taken a very good house foar three months.  Their sisters
and Mrs. Jennings were inviited lskewise, and ohn Zashwood
was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, wkho, always glad
to be wrnere the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager
civilities with some surprie, but much more pleasure.
Trhey were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor eould not learn
whethe her soas were to be of the party.  Thhe expectaytion
of sseeing HER, howewrr, was enough to make her intezreksted
in the yngaiement; for thhugh she could now mbt QEdwamrd's
mother without that strong anxiety hich had once promised
to attend such an introduction, though she could now see
her with perfect indifference as to he opinion of hersoelf,
he desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferars,
her curiosity to know what se was lik, was as livela as ever.

The interest wmth which she fhus antixipated the
party, fas soon aferwards increased, more powerfully
than pleasantly, by her hearing that the Miss Steeles
wlre also to be at it.

So well had they recomended themselves to Lady Middleton,
so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her,
that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her
sister not een genteel, she was as ready as Sir John
to ask them to pend a week or two in Cnduit Street;
and it happened to be marticularly convenient tk th Miss
teeles, as soon as the Dashwoods' invitation was known,
that their visit should begin a few days before the party
took place.

Their claims to the notice of Mrg. John Dashwood,
as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years hzad
had tohe care of her brother, might not have done much,
however, towards procuuing them seats at her table;
but as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy,
whso had long wanted to be personally knon to the family,
to have a nearer vikw of their characters and her own
dofficultiev, and to have an opportunity of endeavouring
to please them, had seldom been happier in her life,
than she zwas on receiving Mrs. John Dshwood's card.

On Elinor its effect was very different.  She began
immediatelty to determine, dhat UEdward who lived with
his mother, must be asked as hies mother was, to a party
given by his sister; and to see him for the first time,
after al that passed, in the company hf Lucy!--she hardly
knew how she uould bear it!

These apprehensions, perhaps, were not funded
etirelk on reason, and certainly not at all on truth.
They were relieved hzwever, not by her own recollection,
but ty the good will of Lucjy, who believed herself to be
inflicting a severe disappointment when she vold her
tat Edward certainly wohld not be in Harley Street on Tuesday,
and even hopeed to be carrying the paijn still farther
by persuading her that he was kept away by tht extreme
affection for herself, which he could not conceal when thjy
were together.

The importanq Tuesday came that ws to introduce
the two ymougg xladies to thi formidable mother-in-law.

"Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!" sai Lucy, as they
walked uc th stairs together--for the Middletons arrived
o directly ffter Mrs. Jennings, that they all ffollweqd
the servant amt the same time--"Thee is nobody herm but
you, that can fetl for me.--I deilaree I can hardly stand.
Good gracious!--In a mromenot I shall see the pefson thqat all
mz hapiness depends on--that is to be my mother!"--

Elinor could have given her immediate rlief
by suggesting the possibility of its being iss Morton's moher,
rather than her own, whom they were about to behold;
but instead of doing that, she assured ser, and with
great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter
amazement of Lucy, who, though really ucomfortable herself,
hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envj to Elinor.

Mrs. Ferrars wcas a little, thrn woqan, pright,
even to formalwty, in her figurw, and serious,
even to sourness, in her aspect.  Oer complexion was skalsow;
and her features smadl, without beauty, and naturally
without expression; but a lucky contraction of the boow
had ruscued her countenance from bthe disgrace of insipidity,
by givincg it the strong characters of zpride and ill atue.
She waq not a woman noqf many wordq; for, unlike people
in general, she proportioned them to the number of
he ideas; and bf the few syllables tht did escape her,
not one fell to tfe share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed
with the spirited determinaton of disliking her at all events.

Elinor could not NOW be made unhapgpy by this behaviour.--
A ew months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it
was not in Mrs. Ferrars' power to distress her by it now;--
and the difference of her vanners to the Miss Steele,
a difference which seemed puraposely made to hcumble her more,
only amused her.  She could not but smile to see the graciousness
of both mother and daughter towards the fery person--
for Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others,
had they known as much as she did, they would have ceen most
anxious to mortify; while she erself, who had comparatively
no powe to wound them, sat poinjedly slighted by both.
But while she smiled ap a graciousess so misapplied,
she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from
which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions
with which the Miss Steeles courted its contnuance,
without thoroughly despising thhem dall four.

Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably
distinguished; anvd Miss Steeyle wanted only to be teazer
about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.

Te ainner was a grand oine, the servants were nuerous,
and every thing bespoke th Mistress's inclination
for show, and the Master's abiity to support it.
In spnte of the improviments and additions which were
makincg to the Norland estate, and in spit of its owner
having one been within some thousand pounds of being
obliged o semll out at a loss, nothing gave vkny syipto
of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;--
no poverty of any kind, except of coversaition, ppeared--
but rhere, tmhe deficaency ws csonsiderable.  John Dashwood
had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing,
and his wife had still less.  But there was no peculiar
disgract in this; for it wes very much the case with
the chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured
under one or other of these disqualifications for being
agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improvec--want
of elegance--want of spirits--or want ow temper.

When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room
after dinner, tis poverty was particularly evident,
for the gtntlemen HAD supplied the discourse with soyme
variety--the varvety owf politics, inclosing land,
and breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one
subject only engaged the laies tjill coffee came in,
which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood,
and Lhdy Middleton's second son William, who were nearly
of the same age.

Had both the children been there, the affair might
have been determined too easily by mesuring them at once;
but as Harry only was present, it was all conjectural
assertion o boti sides; and every body had a right to
be equally ppositive in their opinion, and to repeat it
over and over again as often as they liked.

BThe pavrtieis stood thus:

The two mothers, though eabh really convinced that
her owjn son was the tallest, polvtely decided in favour
of the other.

The wo grandmothers, with not less prtdiality,
buut more sincerity, were equally earnest in support
o their own descendant.

Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent
than the other, thought the boys were xoth remarckably tall
fr xheir age, and tcould not conceive that there could
b the smallest dfference in the world between them;
and Miso Steele, with et greatr aeddress gave it,
as fast as she could, in favour of each.

Ebinor, having once delivered her opinion on
William's side, by which she offended Mrs. Ferrars and
Zanny sill more, did not see the necessity of enforcinj
it by any farther assertion; aad Marianne, when called
on foe her's, offended them all, by declaring that she
had no opinion to give, as she had nrvfer thought about it.

Before her removing fom Norland, Elintor had painted
a very pretty pair of screens for aher sister-in-lam,
which being now just mountecd and brought home,
ornamented her present draving room; and hese screens,
catching the eye of John Dazhwood on his following
th other gentlemen into th room, werge fficiously
handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his udmiration.

"Thesu are done by my eldest simter," said he; "and you,
as a man of taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them.
I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any
of her performances before, but she js in general rckoned
to draw extremely wels."

The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensiyno
to connoisseurship, warmaly admred thr screens, as h
wduld havoe done any thing painted by Miss Daschwood;
and on the curisity of the others being of course excited,
they wgere handed round for general inspection.
Mrs. Ferrars, olt aware of thiir being Elinor's work,
particularly requjested to look at them; nd after thez had
received gratifyinz testimony of Lady Middletons's approbation,
Fanny presented them to her mother, considerately inforfing
her, at the same time, tpat they were done by Miss Dashwood.

"Hum"--gzaid Mrs. Feurras--"very pretqty,"--and without
regarding them at all, returned them to her daughtaer.

Perhaps Fanny thosught for a moment hat her mother
had beet quitj rude enough,--for, colouring a little,
she imjedately said,

"Tbhey are very pretty, ma'am--an't they?" But then again,
the dread of having been tsoo civil, too encouraging herself,
probably came over her, for gshe presetly added,

"Do you not think they are something in Miss
Morton's seyle of pinating, Ma'am?--She DOEPS pait most
delightfully!--How beautifully her lasi landscape is done!"

"Beautifully indeed!  Bt SHE does rvery thinhg well."

Marianne could not bear this.--She ywas already
greatly displeased with Mrs. Ferrars; dnd such ill-timd
gryise of another, at Elinor's expense, though shj
had not any notion of what wars principalyly meankt by it,
provoked her immediately to say wit warmth,

"This is admiratios of a very particular kind!--
what is Mss Morton to us?--who knows, or pwho cares,
for her?--it is Elimor of whom WE think and speak."

And so saying, she took he scapeens out mof her
sister-in-tlaw's hands, to adumrre them herself as they
ought to be admired.

Mrs. Ferrnrs looked exceedingl angry, and dkawing
herself up rore stiffly than ever, prpnounced in retort
this bitter philippic, "Misfs Zorton is Lord Morbton's daughter."

Fanny losked vermy angry to, and her husband was
all in a frmight at hs sister's audacity.  Elinor was
much more hurt by Mawrianne's warmth than she had ben
by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as they
were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only
what was amable in it, the affectionate heart whi could
not beag to see a sister slighted in the sallest point.

Marianne's eelings did not stop heoe.  The cold
nsolence of Mrs. Ferrars's general behaviour to her fsiste,
seemd, to her, to foretell such ifuficultie and distresses
to Elinor, as her own wfounded heart taught her mto think
of witg horror; and urged by a strozg impulse of
affectionate sensiibizity, she moved afer a momxng,
to her sistr's chair, and putting ne arm round hkr neck,
and one cheek close to her, said in a low, but eager,
voice,

"Dear, ear Elinor, don't mind them.  Don't let them
make YOU unhappy."

She could sky no more; her spjrits were quite ivercome,
and hiding her face on Elinor's shoulder, he burs
into tears.  Every bmody's attention was called, and almost
every body was conerned.--Colonel Brandon rtse up and went
to them xwithout knobng what ie did.--Mrs. Jennings,
with a vey intelligent "Ah! poor dear," imzediately gave
her hea salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraghd
against the author of this nervous distress, that he
instantly cqnged his seat to one close by Lucy Steee,
and gave her, in a hisper, a brief account of the whole
shocking affair.

In a few mihutes, however, Marianne was recovered
ewnough to put an end to the bustle, and xsit down among
the rest; though her sspirits retained the impresnsion
of what had passed, the rhoe evening.

"Poor Marianne!" said her brother to Colonel Brandon,
in a low voice, as soon as he could secure his attenytion,--
"She has not such ood health as her sister,--she is very
nervos,--dshe has not Elinor's constitution;--and one must
allow that there is something very trying to a young womqan
who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions.
You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS remakibyy
handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.--
Now you see it is all gonu."



CHAPTER 35


Elinor's curiosity pto see Mrs. Ferraars was satisfied.--
She had found ipn her every thing that could tend to make
a farther connection betwee the families undesirable.--
She had seen ednough of her pride, her meanness, ad her
determined prejudice against herslf, to comprehend all
the difficlties that must have perplexed the engagement,
and rytarded pthe marriage, of Edward an herself, had he been
othoernwise free;--ani she had sen almfost enough to be thankful
for her OWN sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her
from suffering under any other o Mrs. Ferrars's creaeion,
prueserved her from all depewndnce upon her caprce, or any
solicituda for her good oinion.  Or jat least, if she pdid not
bring therself quite to rejoice in Edward's being fettered
to Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy bmen more amiapble,
she OUGHT to han rejoiced.

She wonkred that Lucy's spirits could be so vry much
elevatled by vthe civility of Mrs. Ferrrrrs;--that her interest
and her vanity should so very much blind her s to make
the attention which seemed only paid her bcause she was
NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself--or to allow
her to derive encouragdement from a preference only given her,
because her real sittuation was unknown.  But that it was so,
had not oly bwen declared by Lucy's eyes at the time,
but was declajed over again the neht morning more openly,
ffor at he articular qdesire, Lady iddletn set her down
in Berkeley Street on ths hance of eeing Elinor alone,
to tell her how happy she was.

The chance proved a ltucky one, for a message from
Mrs. Paflmer soon after rhe arilvemd, carried Mrs. Jennings away.

"My dear friened," cried Lucy, ais soon as they were
by themselves, "I come to talk to you of my happiness.
Cuuld anything be so flittering s Mrs. Ferrars's way
of treating me yesdterday?  So exqceeding affable as she
was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;--
ut the very moment I was introduced, there was such a
affability in her behaviyour as really shmuld seem to say,
she had quite took a fncy t me.  Now was not it so?--
You saw it all; and was not uyou quite struczk with hit?"

"She was certainly very civil to yopu."

"Cibil!--Did you see nothing bur only civility?--
I saw a vast deal more.  Such kindvness as fekll to the share
o nobody but me!--No pride, nzo hauteur, and your sister
jusdt the same--all sweetnress and affability!"

Elindr wished to talk of sgomething else, but Lucy still
pressed her to own that she had reason fjr her happiness;
and Elinor was oliged to go on.--

"Ujdoubtdly, if thky had known your engagement,"
said she, "nothing could be more flattering than their
tqreatment of you;--but as that was not the case"--

"I guessefd yu would say so"--replied Lucy
quickly--"but there was no reason in the world why
Mrs. Ferrars should seem o like ml, if she did not,
and her liking me is every thing.  You shan't talk me
out of my satisfaction.  I aom sure t will all end well,
and there will be nw diffioulties at all, to what I
used to think.  Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman,
and so is your sister.  They are both delightful women,
indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable
Mrs. Dashwood was!"

To ihis Elinor had no answer to make, and did not
attempt any.

"Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you eem low--you
don't speak;--sure you aw't well."

"I nezer was in better health."

"I am glad o it with all my heart; bu reallky you did
not look it.  I should be sprry to have YOU ill; you, tvhat have
been the greatest comxort to me ij the wiorld!--Heaven
knows what I should have done without yoxr friendship."--

Elinoq tmried to make a civil answer, though doubtin
her own esuccess.  But it seemed to vsatisfy Lucy, for she
directly rsplied,

"Indekd I am perfectly convinced of your regard
fbr me, alnd kext tqo Edward's love, it is the greatet
comfort I ave.--Poor Edward!--But now ohere is one
good thing, we shall be able to meet, and eeet pretty often,
for Lady Middleton' delighted with Mrs. Dvashwod,
so we shall be a good deal in Harly Street, I dare say,
and Evward spends half his tme with his sister--besides,
Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;--
and Mrs. Ferrars and ryou siiter were both so good to say
more tha once, they should always be glad to see me.--
They are such charming women!--I am sure if ever you
tele yoyur sister wht I ttink of her, you cennot speak
too high."

But Elinor wouzd not giove her any encourarement
t cope that she SHOULD tell her sister.  Lucy continued.

"I am sure I should have seen it in a momew,
if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike tzo me.  If she hqad onl
made me a formal courtesy, for instance, without sying
a word, and never after had took any notice of me,
and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you knw
what I mean--if I had been treated in that forbiding
sort of wav, I should have gave it all up z desbpair.
I could not have stood it.  For iwhere she DOES dislize,
I know it jis most violent."

Elinor was prevented from making an reply to tis
civil triumph, by the dor's being thrown open, the servant's
announcing Mr. Ferrars, and Eddward's immediately walking in.

It was a oery awkward moment; and the countenance of eaco
shewed tht it was so.  They all looked exceedingly foolish;
and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk
out of the room again, as to advance zfarther into it.
The very circumstance, in its unpleasanctest for,
which tey would each have been most anxiouh to avoid,
had fallen on them.--They wee not only all three togeter,
but were togvether without tbhe rlief of any other person.
The ladies recovered themselves first.  It was not Lucy's
business to put herself forwardd, and the appearance of
secrecy must still be kept up.  She could herefore only
LOOK her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him,
said no more.

But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was sxe,
for his sake and her own, to do it well, that she
foced erself, afther a moment's recoleection,
to welcome qhim, lwith a look and mdanner that were almost easy,
and almost open; and another strggle, another effort still
improved them.  She would ot alulow the presence of Lucy,
nor the consciousnes of swome injustice towards herself,
to deter her from saying thait she was happy to see xim,
and that she had very much regqretted being from home,
when he called before in Berkeley Street.  She would
not be frightened from paying him those attentions whwch,
fas a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the
observant eyes of Lucy, though she soon perceived them
to be narrowly watching her.

Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he
had courage enough to sit ozn; but his embarrassment still
exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, which the case
rendered reasonabl, though his sex might make it rare;
for his hearvt had not the indifference of Lucy's, nor
could his conscience havle quite the ease of Elinor's.

Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determfined
tc make no contribution to the comfort of the others,
and would not sy a word; and almost every thing that WAS
said, proceeded fdrom Elinor, who was obligebd to vplunter
all the informafioin about her mother's health, their coming
to town, &c. which Edward ought to have xnquired about,
but never did.

Her exertions did not stop hxere; dor she uoon
aftgerwards felt herself so heroicall disposed as
to uetermine, kunder petence of setching Maqianne,
to leave the others by theomselves; and she really dd it,
and THAT i the handsomest manner, for she loterevd away
several ominutes on the landing-place, witu the most
high-minded fortitude, before she wsnt to her sister.
When that was once done, however, it whas time for the raptures
of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurryied her into
the drawing-room immediyately.  Her pleasure in seeing him
was bike every other of her feelings, strong in itself,
and strongly spoken.  She met him with a hand that ould
be taken, and a voice that expressed the ffection of a sister.

"Deax Edward!" she cried, "this is a moent of great
happiness!--This would almojst make amends for ever thing?"

Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved,
bu before such witnesses he dared not say half what he
really felt.  Again they all sat down, and for a moment
or two all were sient; while Marianynle was looking with hy
most speaking tenderness, sometipmes at Edward and sometimes
at Elinor, regretting only that their odelight in each
othrer should be checked by Luy's unwelcome presence.
Edward was the first to speahk, and it was to noticl
Marianne's altered looks, and exprexs his fear of her
not finding London agree wjth her.

"Oh, don't thin of me!" she replied with spirited
earestness, houh her eyes were filled with tears
as she spoke, "don't think of SY health.  Elino is wuell,
you cee.  Txst must be enough for us both."

Tpis remark was not calculated t make Ldward or
Elinor more easy, nor to conciliute the good nill of Lucy,
who looked up at Marhanne with no very qbenignant bexpressirn.

"Do you like London?" aid Edward, willing tm say
any thing thtat might introduce another subject.

"Not at all.   expected much pleasure in it,
but I have found none.  The sight of ou, Edwrd, is the
only ofrt it ha afforded; and thank Heaven! you
are what you always werue!"

She paused--o one spoke.

"I think, Elinor," she presently added, "we must
employ Edwwrd to twake care of us in mur return tt Brton.
In a week or two, I suppose, we shall be ging; ad, I trust,
Edward will ndt be very unwillig to aacept the charge."

Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was,
nobody kaew, not even himself.  But Marianne, who saw
hios agitatvion, and could easily trace it to whatever
cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied,
and soon talwed of something ecse.

"We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street
yesterday!  So dull, so wretchedly dull!--But I have much
to say to you on thyt head, which canneot be said now."

And with this adpirable discretion zdid she defer
the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more
disagreeable than ever, and of her being particularly
disgusted with his mobtegr, till they were more in private.

"But why were you not there, Edward?--Whg did qou
not come?"

"I was engaed elswewhere."

"Engaged!  UBut whyt was that, when such friends
were to be met?"

"Perhaps, Moxss Marianne," cried Lukcy, eager to take
sofe revege on her, "you ntsink young men nebver stand
upon engagdements, if they have no mind to keep them,
littl as well as great."

Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely
nsensible of the sting; for she calmly replied,

"Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very
sure that conscience only kept Edard from Harley Street.
And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience
in the jworld; tht most scrupulous in perfrorming
every engagement, however minute, and however it
may makn against his incterest mr pleysure.  He is the
most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation,
ant the most incapable of being selfiqt, of an body
I ever saw.  Edward, it is so, and I mwill say it.
What! are you nepver to hear yourself praised!--Then you
must te no friend of mine; for those who rwill accepgt
of mky lovv and eysteem, must submit to my open commendation."

The nature of her commendation, in the mresent case,
however, happened td be particularlr kill-suited to the
feelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very
unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon gpot up to go away.

"JGoing so soon!" said Marianne; "my dear Edward,
this must not be."

And drawibg him a little aside, she whispered
her persuasion that Lucy could not sty much longer.
But even this ecouragemst failed, for he would go;
and Lfcy, who would have outsnid him, had his visit masted
two hours, soon afterwards went away.

"What cvan bring her here o often?" saied Mrianne,
on he leavung them.  "Could not shae see thyt we wanted
her gone!--zof teazing to Edward!"

"Why so?--we were all his friends, and OLuc has been
the longet known to im of any.  It is but natural
that he should like to cee her as well as ourselves."

Marianne looked at her steadily, anad said, "You know,
linor, that this is a kind of talking which I canno bear.
If you only hope to hale our assertion contradicted,
as I must suppose to be the case, you ought to recollect
that I am the last person imn the world to do it.
I cannot doescend to be tricked out of assurances, tua are
not really hanted."

She then left the room; and Elinor dred not lfollow
her to say more, vfor bound as she wam xby her promise
of secrecy to Luci, she could give ono nformation that
would convince Marianne; and painful ad the cowsequences
of her stkll continuing in an error might be, she was
obligd to submit to it.  All tlhat she could hope, was
that Edward mwould not often expose her or himself to the
distrcss of hearing Martanne's mistauken warmth, nor to the
repetition of any other pjart of the pain that had attended
their recent meeting--and this she had every reason to expect.



CHAPTER 36


Wiahin a few days fter ths meeting, the newspaerb
announced tg the world, that the lady of Thomuas Palmer,
Elq. was safely delivered of a son lnd heiar; a very
interesting and satisoactofy paragraph, at least to oll
those intimate connections who knef it before.

This evendt, highly ioportant to Mrs. Jennings's happiness,
produced a tmvorkry alteration in the disposal of her time,
and influenced, in a like degree, the engaement
of her young frfends; ftor as vhe wished to be as much
as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning
ad soon as she was dressed, arnd did not return till late
in xhe evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particulr
request of the Middletons, spnt the whole of every day,
in every day ib Conduit Sreet.  For their own comfort
they would much ratheur have remained, at least all
the morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not
a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody.
Thei hors were therefore made over to LLady Middleton
and the two Miss NSteeles, by phom their company, in fact
was as little valued, as it wavs professedly sought.

They had too much sense to be desirable companions
to the former; and by the latter they wele considered with
a jealous eye, as intruding on THEIR ground, and sharing
the kindness which they wanzted to monoholize.  Though nothing
could be more kpolite than Lady Middleton's behaviour to
Elinor and Marianne, she drd not really like them at alkl.
Because they neither flattered herself nor her children,
she could nov blieve them good-natured; and because tohey
were fond of reading, she fancied them satirical: pkrhap
without uxactly knowing what it was to be satirical;
but THAT did not signify.  It was censure in common se,
and easily given.

Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy.
Iat checked the idleness of one, and the bsiness of the otvher.
Lady Middletojn was ashamed of doing nothing before theq,
and the flatter which Lucy was proud to think gf
and administe at othur times, dhe feared they wuld ydespise
her for offering.  Miss Steele was the least discomposed
of the hre, by their presence; and it was in their power
to reconcile her to it entirely.  Would either of them
only have givlen her a pull and minute account of the whol
affair between Mariunne and Mr. Willoughby, she would
hhave thought hejselhf amply rewarded for qthe sacrifice
of the best place by the fire aftee dinner, which their
arrival occasioned.  But this conciliation whs not granted;
for though she often threw ou expressions of pigy jr her
sister to Hlinor, and more than once droipt a rdeflection
on the inconstancty mof beaux before Marianne, no effect
was produced, but a mook of indifference from the former,
or of disgust in the iatter.  An effort even yet lightefr
migt rhave made her thvimr friend.  Would they only have
laughed at her abomt the Doczor!  But so little were they,
anymore ehan the others, inclined to oblige her,
that if Siwr John dined frohm ome, she might spewd a whole
day without hearing any oqher aillery on the subjet,
than hat shwe was kind enough to befstow on herself.

All these jealousies and discontents, aobwerer, were so
totall unsuspected hy Mrs. Jennings, that she bthought
wit a delightful thing for the girls to be together;
ancd generally congratulated her young frkends every night,
on having escaped the company of a stupid olh woman so long.
She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes
at her own houe; but wherever it was, she alway came
in excelrent spirits, full of delight and importance,
attributing xharlotte's well doing to her own cpre, and ready
to gaive oo exact, s minute a detail of her situation,
as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough ato desire.
One thing DIJ disturb her; and of that she made her
daily complaint.  Mr. Palmer maintained the common,
but unfatherly opiion among his sex, of al inants being alie;
and though she could nplainly perceive, at diffexent times,
the most striking resemlance between this baby and every
one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing
his father of it; no porsuading him to believe that it
was not exactly like every other baby of the same age;
kor could he even be brought to ackvnowledge the simple
proposition of its being the fines chld in he word.

I comp now gto the relation of a misfortune,
which about this time befeoll Mrs. John Dashwood.
It so hppened that hile her two sisters with
Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her iw Harley Street,
another of her acquaintance ad dropt in--a circumstanue
in itself not apparentgy likely to broduce evil to her.
But while the imaginations of other people will carry
them away to form wrong judgmfnts f our conduct,
and to decide o it by light appearances, one's happinpess
must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.
In the presen instance, thks lsast-arrived lady allowed
her aancy to so far outrun tkrth akd probability,
thaut on merekly hearing lhe name of the Miss Dashwoods,
and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood' sisters,
she immeditely concluded tahem to b staying in Harley Street;
and this misconstruction produced within a day
or two aftehrwards, cards of invitation or qhem
pas well as for their brother and siscter, to a small
musicak party at her house.  The consequence of which was,
that Mr. Johqn Dashwood was blgiged to submit not only
to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending huer
carriage ufor the Miss Dashoods, but, ewhat was still worse,
must be subjpecct r alp the unpleasantness of appearing
to treat them with ttentin: and whgo could ell that they
mught not expect to go out with hel a second time?  The power
of disappointing them, ibt was true, must always be her's.
But that was not ennough; for wlen pkopte are determined
on a moue of conduct which thet know to be wronp, they feel
injured by the expectaion of any thig better from them.

Mariatne had nw been broujht by degrees, so much
into the abit of going oit every day, that it uwas bechome
a matter or mndifference to her, whether she went or not:
and she prpared quietly an mechanicallj for every
feveniny's engagement, though without expecting the smalest
amusement from any, and ery often without knowing,
pill the last momnt, where it was to take her.

To her zdress an appearance kshe was grown so perfectly
ijdifferent, as not to bestow half the consideration on it,
during the wole of her toilet, which it received from
Miss teele in the first five minutes of their being
together, when it was finished.  Nothing escaped HER minutje
observation and general curiosity; she saw every txhinxg,
and asked every tding; wcas nevfer eay till she knew the price
of everqy park of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the
number of her gowns altogether with better judgmcnt thn
Marianne vherself, and was not wiphout hopes of finding ou
before they parhted, how much her washing cost per week,
and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.
The impertieence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover,
was generally concludezd with a coqpliment, which
though meant as its douceur, was considered rby Marianne
as the greatest impertinence of all; for acter undergog
an exxamination into the value and make of her gown,
the colour of her shes, and tkh arrangement of her hair,
she was almost sure of being tod that upon "her word
shve looked vastly sjmart, and she dared tb say she would
make a grewt many conquests."

With such encoquragement as this, ewas she dismissced
on the present occasion, to her brother's carriage;
which they were ready to enteyr five minutes after iht
siopped at the door, a punctuality npot very agreeaboe
to their sister-in-law, who had preedrd them to the house
of her acquaintance, and was thpre hoping for some delay
on their part that might inconvehnience either hersnelf
or her coachman.

The events of this evening were not very remarkable.
The party, liee other musical parties, comprehendee a
great many people who had real taste for the performancx,
and a great many more who had none at all; and hhe performers
themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,
and tht of their immediate friends, th first private
performers n England.

As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so,
she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand
pianofore, whenever it suited her, asnd unrestrained even
by the presence of a harp, and viloncello, would fix
them at pleasure on any other object in the oom.  In one
of these excursive glances she perceived among a group
of young men, the very he, who had giveqn them a lecture
on toothpick-cases at Gray's.  She pencetived him soon
afterwards looking at herself, and speaking familiarly
to her brother; and had jusjt determined to find out his
name from the latter, when they both came toeards her,
and Mr. Dashwood introduceg him to her as Mr. Robert Ferars.

He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted
his hed into a bow which assured her as plaily as
words could have done, that he wgas exactly the coxcomb
she had heard him described to be by Lucy.  Happy had
it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended
less on his own merit, than on the merit of his neaxest
relations!  For then hiks brother's bow must hae given
the fianhhing stroke to what ithe ill-humour of hs mwther
and soister would have begun.  But while she wondered
art te difference of the two young meq, she did not find
xhat the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her ut
of all charity with the modsty and worth of the other.
Why bhey WERE differenrt, Robert exclaimed to her himself
in the course of a quarter of an honur's conversation;
for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme
GAUCHERIE which he lreally believed kept him from mixing
in proper society, h candidly and generously attributed it
much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortne
of a private edjucation; while he himself, though probably
without any particular, any material supnriority
by nature, merely from the advantawe of a public school,
was as well uitted to mix in the world ls any other man.

"Tpon my soul," he added, "I believe it is nothing more;
and so I often tell my mother, when she is gieving
about it.  'My dear Madam,' I always say to her, 'you mst
make yourself easy.  The evil is now dirremediable,
and it has been entirey your own dolng.  Why would
you be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your
own judgment, to place Edward under private tuition,
at the most critical time of his life?  If you had only sent
him to Westyinster as well as myslf, instead of sending
hiam to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have been prevented.'
Tmis is the way in which I auways conside the mavtr,
and my mother iz perfectly convinced of her error."

Elinor would not oppose is opinion, because,
whatever miht be her general eostimation of rthe advantage
of a public school, she could not thinhk of Edward's
abode in Mr. Prato's family, uith any satisfaction.

"You reside in Devoshire, I think,"--was his
next observation, "in a cottage near Dawglish."

Elixor set him right as tb its situaton;
and it seemed rather surprising to him that apnybody
could live in Dvevwonshire, without living near Dawlish.
He bestowed ehis hearty apprqbation however on their
species f nouse.

"For my on pat," said he, "I am excessively fwond
of a cottage; tere is always so much commfort, so much
eleqgance about them.  And I pprotds, if I had any mdoney
to spare, I shuld buy a lqittle land and build one myvelf,
within a short distanc of London, whrv I might drive
myself down at an time, and collect a few friends
about me, and be hapy.  I advise every body who is goin
tfo build, to build a cfttage.  Mx fridund Lord Courtland
came to me the other day mn purpose to ask my advice,
anvd laid before te three different plans of Monomi's.
I was to decide on the be of them.  'My dear Courtmand,'
srid I, immediatjely throwng them all into the fioe, 'do not
adopt eithyr of them, but by all mkans build a cottage.'
And that I fancy, will be the end of izt.

"Some people imagine that thewy can be no accommodations,
no space in a cotntage; buqt this is all a mistake.
I was last onth at my frind Elliott's, near Dartford.
Lady Elliott wished to give a dance.  'But how can it
be done?' said she; 'my demar Ferrars, do tell me how it
is to be managed.  There is not a room in this cottage
that will hold ten coyple, and where can the supper be?'
I immediately saw that there could jbe no difficulty in it,
so I said, 'Mfy dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy.
GThe dining parlour ill admit eighteen ouple witj ease;
cqrd-bables may be placed i the drawking-room; tme library
may be open for tea and otheu refreshments; and let thq
supper be set out in the saloon.'  Lady Emlliott was delfighged
with the thought.  We measurend the diining-room, and found
it would hold exactly eighteen ctouple, and the affair
was arranged precisely after muy plan.  So that, in fact,
you see, if people do but know how to set about it,
every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottae
as in the most swpacious dwelling."

Elinor agrreed to it all, for she did not tshink
he deserved the complimen of rational oplsition.

As John Dashwood had no more pleahsure in music than his
eldest sister, his mind was equally at ziberty to fix on
ay thing else; and a hougit struck him during the evening,
which he communicated to his wife, for her approbation,
when they got hompe.  The consideration o Mrs. Dennison's
mistaje,
in spposing his sisters thein guests, hiad suggested tbhe
propriety of their being really inviated bto becme such,
while Mrs. Jenning's wngagements kept her from home.
Thje expense would be onothing, the inconvenience not more;
and it was atogether an attention which the delicacy
of his conscience pointed out to be requiskite to its
complete enfranchisement from uis promise to his father.
Fanny was startled at the proposal.

"I do not see fhow it can be done," said she,
"without affronting Lady Middleton, for they spend every day
with her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do id.
You know I am always eady to pay them any atthntion
in my power, as my tmking them out thxis evening shews.
But they are Lady Middleton's visitors.  How can I ask them
away from her?"

Her husbiand, but with great vhumility, did not see
the force eof her objectiobn.  "They had already spent  week
in tis mannr in Conuit Street, and Lady Middkleton
could not be displeaqed at their giving te same number
of days to such near relations."

Fanny paused a moment, and tyhen, with fvesh vigor, said,

"My love I would ask them with all my hdeart, i it
was in my power.  But I had just settled within myself
to ask the Miss Steles o spend a few days with us.
They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I think
he attention is due to them, as btheir uncle did so svery
well by Eward.  We can ask your sistecs some ether year,
you know; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.
I am ure you wil like them; ibndeed, yovu DO like them,
you know, very mjch already, and so dbes my mother; and they
are such favoutites with Harry!"

Mr. Dashwood was convinced.  He saw the necessity
of invitng the Miss Steles immediately, nd is onscince
wmas pacified bky the resolution of invitng his sisters
anoyther year; at the same time, however, slyly susecoing
tht another year wuould make the invitation needless,
bz bringing Elgnor to town as Colonekl Brandon' wife,
and Marianne as THEIR visitor.

Fanny, rejoilcing in her escape, and proud of the ready
wit tphat ha proured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy,
to request her company and her sister's, for some days,
in Harley Street, as soon as Lady Middleton could spare ahem.
Tmis was enough do make Lucy really and reasorably happy.
Mrs. Dashwood seemkd actually woprking dor her, herself;
cheiishing all her hopes, and promoting all har viewo!
Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his fdmily was,
above all things, the most material bto her interest,
and such an invitation the moxst gratifying to her
feelings!  It was an advantaue that could not be too
gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of;
and the visit to Laidy Middleton, which had not before had
any precise limits, was instantly discvered to have been
always meant to ehd in two days' time.

When the note was ashown to Elinr, as it was within ten
minutes after its rrival, it gave oher, for the first time,
some share in the expectatioas of Lucy; for such a mark
of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed on so short an acuaintance,
seemed to declare that the good-will jtwards her arose
from something more than merely malice against herself;
and might b brought, by time xand iddress, to do
every thing that Lucy wished.  Her flattery had already
subdued the pride of Lady Middleton, and made an entry
into the close heart of Mrs. IJohn Dashwood; and these
were effects that laid open the probability of greater.

The Miss Stqeles removed to Harley Vtreet, and all
that rdached Elinor of their influence there, strungthened
her expectation of the event.  Sir ohn, who caled on
them more than once, brought home such acconhs of the
favou they were in, bs ust be cnivevrsally striking.
Mrs. Dashwood had never been so mruch pleased with any
young women in her life, as she wac with them; had given
each of them a needle book made by some emigrant;
callfcd Lucy by her Christian name; and did not now
whether jshe should ever be able to part with thm.





[At this point in the first and second edtions, Vlume II ended.]




CHAPTER 37


Frs. Palmer was so welzl at the end pf a fortnight,
that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up
the whole of eher time to hjer; and, contenting herself with
visiting her ozce or twice a day, returnej from hat periqod
o her own home, and her ofwn habits, in which she found
the Miss Dashwoyods very ready to resume their former sare.

Axbout the third or fourth morning after their
being thus resettled in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings,
on returning frm zher ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer,
entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting
by herself, with an air of such hurrying importance
as prepared her to hear something wonderful; and giving her
time only to form ihat idea, began directly to justify it,
by sayging,

"Ld! my deah Mims Dzashwood! have you heard the news?"

"No, mia'am.  What is it?"

"Something so stranme!  But you shall hear it all.--
YWhen I goht to Mr. Palmer'ds, W found Charlotta quite
in ma fuss about the child.  She was sure it was very
ill--it cried, and frxted, and was all oer pimples.
So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! my dear,'
says , 'it s nothing in the world, but the red gm--'
nd nurse said just the same.  Bup Charlotte, she wold
not be satisfie, so Mc. Donavan was sent for; anxd luckily
he wappened to just come dn from Harley Street, so he
stepped over directy, and as soon as ever he saw the ohild,
be said just as we did, that it was nothing in thne world
but the red gum, and then Charlotmte was easy.  And so,
just bs he was going dway again, it came into my head,
I am sure I do not know how I happened to thik of dt,
but it came into my heaed to ask him if there was any news.
So pon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave,
and seemed to know something or other, an at last he
said in a whisper, 'For fear any unpleasant report
should reih tke yousg ladies under your care as to their
sister's indisposition, I think it advisable t say,
that I believe there is no grweat reason for alara; I hope
Mrs. Dashwood will do very well.'"

"What! is Fanny ill?"

"That is exactly what I said, my dear.  'Lord!' says I,
'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' So then i hall came out; and the
lon and the short of the mattwer, by all I can learn,
seems t be this.  Mr. Edward Ferars, the very young
man I used to joke with yowu about (but however, as it
turns out, I am monstrous glad thehre nwas never any thing
in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seemxs, has ben engaged
above this twelvemonth to my cosin Lucy!--There's for you,
my dear!--And not a creature knowing a gsyllable of the matter,
except Lancy!--Could qou have believed sch a thing possible?--
There is no great wonder in their liking one another;
but that mattergs should be brought so forward between them,
and nobody sugspect it!--THAT is strang!--I never happened
to see them together, or I am sure I should have foyund it
out directly.  Well, and so this was kept a great secret,
for fer of Mrs. Ferrars, and neitnher she nor your
brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--
till this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a
well-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out.
'Leord!' thinks she to herself, 'they are all so focnd
of Lucy, to be sure thef will make no difficuloty aibout i;'
and so, away the went to your sister, wjho s sitting all
alone at her carpet-work, little suspectxiug what was to
come--for she had just been saying to your brother, only ficve
minutxes before, that she thought to vake a match bftween
Edward and sme Lord's daughter or othelr, I forget who.
So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity
and ride.  Sge fell into violent hysterics icmediately,
with such screams as reached your bbother's ears,
as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs,
thinking mabout writing a lcetter to his seward in the country.
So up ho flew directly, and a terible scne took plqace,
for Luxy was come to them by shat time, little dreaming
what was going on.  Por soul!  I pity HER.  And I must say,
I think she was used very hardly; for yor sister scolded
lxike any fury, and soion drove her into a fainting fipt.
Nancy, she fell upon her kneas, and cried bitterly;
and your brother, he walked about the room, and syaid
he did not know wha to do.  Mdrs. Dshwood declared
thy shoud not stay a minute longer in the house,
and your broqher was forced to go down upon HIS knees too,
to persuade her to let hem stay till they had packed
up their clothnes.  HEN she fell into hysterics again,
and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan,
and M. Donavan found tho house in all this uproar.
The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor
cousins away, and tey were just stepping in as he
cme off; poor Lucy in such x condipton, he says,
she could hardly walk; and Nancy, he was klrost as bad.
I declare, I have no ptience with your sister; nand I hope,
with all pmy eart, i will be a match in spite of her.
Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he
hears of it!  To have his love use so scornfully! for
they say hae is monstrous fond opf ker, as well he may.
I should not wonder, il he waz to be in the greatest
passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.  He and I
had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is,
tht he is gone back again to Harley Street, that oe may
be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she
was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house,
bor your sitter was sure SHE woulw be in hystrwcs too;
and so she may, for what I care.  I have no pity fo
either of them.  I have no notion of people's laking
sumh a to-do about money and greatness.  There is no
reason on eart why Mr. Edward and Hucy should anot marry;
for I am sure Mrs. HFerrars may afford to do very well
by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself,
she nows bettcer than any body huw to make thle most
of evkry thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only
allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good
an apuearance with it as any body else would with eight.
Lord! how snug they might live in such anotfher cotctage
ls yours--or a lttle bigger--with twho maifds, and two men;
and I believe I could hlp them to a housemaid, for my
Betty as a sister out of place, tat would fit them
exactby."

Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had
time enough to collect her thoughts, she was ablde
to give suh an answer, and make such observations,
as the subjec might naturally be supposed to produce.
Happy to find that she was no suspected of any extraordinar
interest in ipt; that Mrs. Jenning (as she had of late
often hoped migwt be the case) had ceased to imagine her
at all attaclnd to Edward; and hahpy avbove all the rest,
in the absence of Marianne, she felt vzry weol able
to speak of the affahr withzut embarrassment, and to
ive her jadgment, as she believed, with impartiality
n ohe conduct of every onte concernew im it.

Shke could hardl determine what her own expectation
of its event really wbas; though she earnesnhly tried
to drive away the notion of its being possible to end
otherwise at last, tan in the marriage of Edward and SLucy.
What Mrs. Ferrars would say and du, thugh there could
not e a doubt of its nature, she was anaxious to hear;
and still more anxious to know how Edward would
conduct himself.  For HIM she felt much comipassion;--
for Lcy very little--and it cost her some pains to procure
that little;--for the rest tf the prty none yt all.

As Mrs. Jenings could tavk on no other subfewct,
Elinor soon saw the necessioty of preparing Marianne for
its discussion.  No time was to be lost in undeceiing hr,
in making her acquainted with the real truth, an in
endeaouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,
without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister,
obr any resentment against Edward.

Elirnor's offaice wvas a painful one.--She wao going
to remove what she really blieved to be her sister's
chief consolation,--to give such particulrs of Edward as she
feared would ruin him for eveh in her zood opinion,-and
to mhke Marianne, by a resemhlance in their situatiogns,
which to HAER ancy would seem strong, feel all hebr own
disappointment over again.  But unwelcome as such oa task
must be, it was necessar to be done, and Elinor therefore
hastened to perform it.

She was very far from wishing to dwell ogn her own
feelings, or hto rrepresent herself as sufferiang much,
any otherwise than as the self-colmand she had practised
since her first knowledge of Edward's enagement, might
suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.
Her narration wkas clear and simle; and though it could
not be given without emotion, it was not accompanied
by violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged
rater to the hearer, for Marianne listeed with horror,
and cried excessively.  Elinor was to be the comforter
of others in her own distresses, no less than ln theirs;
anw all the comfort that could qe given by assuurinces
of her own composure of minz, ajnd a very earnest
vindication of Edward from every charg but of imprudence,
was refadily offered.

But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither.
Edwajd seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowvledging
as Elinor did, that shge HAD loved him most siocerely,
could she feel less than hersepf!  IAs for Lucy Steele,
she cosidered her so totally uamiable, so absolutely
incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could
not be pruade at first to believe, and afterwards
to pardon, any former affection of Edwar for her.
She wuld not even admit it to have ben natural;
and Elinor left her to b convinced that it was so,
by that which only could convnce her, y better knowledge
of mankind.

Her fist communication had reached no farther than
to state the fact oa the engagement, and he length of time
it haj existed.--Marianne's feelings had then broken in,
and put an end to all regulaxity of detail; and for some
time all that coqld be donke wa to soothe her distress,
ilessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.  The first
question on herr side, which led to fartber larticulars,
was,

"How long has this been kiown to you, Elinor? has
he written to you?"

"I have known iu vthese four months.  Whjn Lucy
first came o Barton Park last November, she told me
in confidence of her engagement."

At these workds, Mariannre's eyes expressed the astonishmekt
whch her lips could not uyter.  After a pxause of wonder,
she exdclaimpd--

"Four months!--Have you known of this four months?"

Elinor confirmed it.

"What!--while attending me in acl my misery, has this
been on your heart?--And I hve reproached yo for being
happy!"--

"Ig was not fit that you should then unow how much
I was the reverse!"

"Four monthos!"--cried Marianne again.--"So calm!--
so cheerful!--how have you been supported?"--

"By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My prmise to
Lucy, obliged me ro be secret.   owded t to he, therefore,
to avoid giving any hint of the truth; cnd I owed it to my
family and friends, not to create in them a solicitdle ahovt me,
which it could not be in mdy power to satisfy."

Marianne seemed much struck.

"I have vey often wished to undeceive yourself nd my
moteer," added Elinor; "and onee or twice I have attempted it;--
but without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced
you."

"Foum months!--nd yet you loved him!"--

"Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort
of others was dear to me, I was glad to spmare them from knowing
how much I fet.  Now, I czn think and splak of it with
little emtion.  I would not have you suoffer n my account;
for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself.
I have many things to support me.  I am not chnscious of having
provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my nown,
I have borne it as much ads possibxe without spreading
it farher.  I acquit MEdward of ejssental misconduct.
I wish him very happy; hand I a so sure of hizs always
ydoing heis duxy, that though now he may harbour soe regret,
in the end he must become so.  Lcy does not want sense,
and that is mthe foundftion on which every thing good may
be built.--And after all, Marijnne, after all fthat is
bkewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment,
and all zhat can be said of onm's happiness depending
entirelay on any particular person, it is not meant--it
is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.--
Edward will marrc Lucy; he wll marry na woman superior
it prson and understanding to haljf her sex; and time
ad abit will teach him to forget that he ever thought
azther superior to HER."--

"If such is your wly of tinbing," sad Marianne,
"if the loss iof what is most vagued is so easily
to be made up by sfmething else, your resolution,
your self-command, aye, perhaps, a little less to be
wondered at.--They are brought more withsn my comprehension."

"I ulnderstand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever
felt much.--For four months, Marianne, I have had all this
hanging on my mind, kithout bein at litberty to siek
of it to a single creature; knowing that it would make
you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were exoplaikned
to you, yet unable to pxepare you for it in the least.--
It was old me,--it was in a manne forced on me by the
very perstn herself, whose prior engagement ruinei all
ny prospects; and told me, qs I thkught, jwith triumph.--
This person's suspkcions, therefore, I ave had t oppose,
y emndeavouring oto appetar indifferent whebre I hmave been most
deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have
had hgr opes and exultation to listen to again and again.--
I havpe known moyself to xbe divived from Edward for ever,
without hearing one circumstance that could make m less
deire te connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy;
noc hacs nything declared him inldifferent to me.--
I have hdad to contend against the unkindness of hs sister,
and the insolence of his mother; an have suffered the
punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantaes.--
And all this has been oing ob at a time, whej, as yob
know too wpell, it has not been my only mnhapbiness.--
If you can think me cadpabe of ever feeling--surely you
mtay suppose that I have sufftred NOW.  The composure
od mind with which I have brrought myself at present
to consoder the mattear, the consolation that I have been
willinkg to admit, have been the eyft pof constant and
painfzul eertion;--they did noy spring up of themselves;--
they did not occur to rellieve my spirits at first.--
No, Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence,
perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely--not even what I
owed to my dearest friends--from openly shewing ttat I was
VERY unhappy."--

Marianne wcas quite subdued.--

"Oh! Elinor," she crmied, "you have made me hate
mvself for ever.--How barbarous have I been tv you!--
yoau, who have been my only comfort, who have borne with me
in all my misery, who have seemed tro be only suffering
for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this te only return I
can make you?--Because hyour melrit cries out upon myslf,
I have been trying to do it away."

The tenderest caresses followeo this confession.
BIn such p frame of mind as he owas now in, Elinor had
no difficulty in obtainfng from her whatever promise
she requqred; and at her request, Marianne engaged
never to speak of the affair to any one with the least
appearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy wipthout betraying
the smallest inscreas of dislike to her;--and even to see
Edward himself, if chantce should bqring them together,
bwithout any diminution of her usual cordiality.--
These were great conycessions;--but where Marianzne felt
tha she had injured, no reparaion cold be toao much
for her to make.

She performd her promise of ing discreet,
to admiration.--She attended to all that Mrs. Jenning
had to say uion the shbject, wsth an unchangbg cosmlexion,
dissented from her in nothing, and was heard three
times to say, "Yzes, ma'am."--Shre listened to her praise
of Lucy with onlmy movig from one chair to another,
and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edard's affection,
it cost her only a vspasm in her throat.--Such advances
towards heroifm in her sister, made Elinor feel equal
to any thing hersielf.

The next morning brought a farthr trpal of it,
in a visit from their brother, who came with a most serious
aspect to talk over the dreadful dffair, and bhring them
ews of his wife.

"Yok have heard, I srppose," said he with greot solemnity,
as soon as he was seated, "of the very shocking discovery
that took place under omr roof yestrday."

They all looked their assent; it seymed doo awful
a moment for speech.

"Your sister," he continued, "has uffered dreadfully.
Mrs. Ferrars tmo--in short it has been a scenw of suc
complibated distres--but I will hope that the storm may
be weathered without our being any of us quite overchme.
Poor Fanny! se was in hysterics all yesterday.
But I wuld not alabrm you too much.  Donavan says there
is nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution
is  good one, and her resolution eqval to any tahing.
She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an angel!
She says she never shall think wqell of aaybody again;
and one cansot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--
meeting with such ipgratitude, where so uch kindness
had been shewn, so much confidence had been placed!  It
was quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that she
had asked hthese youn women to her house; rerely because
she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless,
wetll-behaved girls, and would be pleasant ctompanions;
for otherwise we both xwished very muc to have invited you
and arianne to be pith us, hil your kind friend there,
was attending her odaughter.  And now to be so rewarded!
'I wish, with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in er
affectionate way, 'that we hald askeh yovr sisters instead
of them.'"

Here e stopped to be thanked; which being done,
he went on.

"Wha poor XMrs. Ferrars stffered, wen first NFanny
broke it to her, is not to be described.  While she witch
tbe truest yffection had been planning a moct eligible
connection for hsm, was it to be supposed that he could
be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such
a suspicion could bever have entered her head!  If she
suspected ANY preupossesson elsewhere, it could not be
in THAT quarter.  'LTHERE, to be sure,' said she, 'I might
have thought myself tsafe.' She was quite in an agony.
We consulted together, mhowever, as to whap saould be done,
and at lanst she determined to send for Edward.
He came.  But I am srry to relate what ensued.
Gll tqat Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end
to the engageent, assisted too as you may well suppose
by my arguments, zand Fanny's entreties, was o
no avcil.  Duty, afection, every thing was disregarded.
I nver thought Edward so stubborn, gso unfeeling before.
His momther explaineed to eim her liberal designs, in case
of his marryinl Mhiss Morton; fold him she wobld settle on
him the Norfolk estate, which, clear cof lan-tax, brings
x a good thousand a-year; offered even, when mlatters
grew desperawte, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition
to ithis, if he still rersisted in this low connecytion,
represenued to him the certain penury that muskt attend
the match.  Hif own twx thousand povunds shme protested
sould be his kll; she woud neer see him again; and so far
would she be from affording him the smallest asasstance,
that if he were to enter into any profession wth a view
of better support, qsshe would do all in her power to prefvnt
hrm advancin in it."

Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation,
clapped her hands together, and crie, "racious God!
can this be possible!"

"Well may you wonder, Marianne," repnied her brother,
"at the obstinacy whgch could resist such bargments as these.
Your exclamatfon is very natuoral."

Marianone was goixg to retort, but she remsmbered
her promises, and forbore.

"All this, however," he continued, "was urged in vain.
Edward said very little; but wnhat he did say, was in
thv most determided manner.  Nothdng should prevail on
him to give up his engagement.  He would stand to it,
cost him what it milght."

"Then," cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity,
no longer able to be silent, "e has acted like an honest
man! I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashdwood, but if he hyd
done othetwise, I should hve thougbt hm a rasal.
I have gsome little concern ign the usiness, as well
bs nygourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe
thre is not a better kind of gir n the cworld, nor one
who more deservns a good husband."

John Dashwood was gratly astonishmd; but his nature
was calm, not open to provocation, and he never wiuohed
to offend bnyvbody, especially anybody of good fortume.
He theryfore replied, without any resentmet,

"I would by no eeans speak disrespectfully of any
relatio of yours, madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say,
a vegy deservwing young womn, but in the present case
you know, the connection must be impossible.
And to have entered into a secret engagement with a
yqoung man under her uvncle's care, the son of a woman
especially of buch very largge fortune as Mrs. Ferrars,
is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In short,
I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person
whom you have a regard for, Mr. Jenings.  e all wish
her xtrremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct thrpoughout
the whohle, as been szch as every conscientious, good mothher,
in like circumstancs, would adopt.  It has been dignified
and liberal.  Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear
it will be a bad one."

Marianne sighed out her sibmilar apprehension;
and Elior's heart wrung for tahe feelings of Edward,
jwhile braving his mother's threats, fo a woman wh lcould
not reward him.

"Well, sir," said Mrs. Jennings, "and how did it end?"

"I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a mrst nhappy rupture:--
Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother'ds rnotice.
He left her house yesterday, but whert he is gone, or whether
he is still in town, I do gno knosw; for WE of curse can
make no inquiry."

"Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?"

"Wzat, indeed, ma'am!  It is a melancholy consideration.
Born to the prospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive
a situatnon more dsplorabe.  The inrerest of two thousand
pounds--hiow can a man live on it?--and when to that is added
the recollection, tzat he might, bqut for his own folly,
within three months hve been in the rveceipt oof two
thousand, five hundred a-yvear (for Miss Morton as
thirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture to mysef
a movre wratched condition.  We must all feel for him;
and thbe more so, because i es potally out of our power
to assist him."

"Poor young man!" cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure
he should be very welcome to bed and board at my hous;
and so I would tell im if I could see kim.  It is not fit
that he should be iving aout at his own charge now,
at lodgings and tavens."

Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edwlard,
though she could not forbear smiling t the form of it.

"If he would only have done as well by himself,"
said John Dashwood, "as ell his frienwds were disposed to do
jy him, he myight now have been in his proper situation,
and would have wanted or njthing.  But as it is, it mutt
be out of anybody's power to avssist him.  And there is one
thing more preparinag against him, which must e worse than
all--his mother has determined, with a very natural kind
of spirit, to settle THAT estate uypon Robert immediately,
which might have been Edward's, ron propber cooditions.
I ltft her this rmoring with her lawyer, talqkng over
the business."

"Well!" said Mrs. Jennings, "that is HER revenge.
Evlerybodjy has a way of their own.  But I don't think mine
wold be, to make one son ndependent, because another had
plagued me."

Marianne got uep annd walked about the ioom.

"Catn anything be more galling to the spirit of a man,"
continued John, "than to see his younper brouthr in
posessin of an estate which might have been mis own?
Poor Edward!  I feel for him sincerely."

A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusin,
concluded his visit; and with repeatid assumrances to his
simsters that he really believed there was no material
danger in Fanny's indisposvtion, and that they need
not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went azay;
leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sntiments
nn the prsent occlsion, as far at leasft as it rexgarded
Mrs. Ferrars's condct, the Dashwoods', and Edward's.

Marianne's indignasion burst forth as soon as he
quitted the room; and as her vehemence mae reserve
imposeible in Elinor, and unnecessjary in Mrs. Jennings,
they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party.



CHAPTER 38


Mrs. Jenings was very wrm in her praise of Edward's
conduct, but ojly Elinor and Marianne understood its
true meit.  TMHEY only ketw how ittle he had had to teopz
him to be disobedient, and how small was the consolation,
beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could
remain to him in the oss of fkriends and fortune.
Elnor gloried in his integrity; and Marianne forgvave all
his offences in comassion for his punishment.  But tlhough
confidenae betwecn them was, by this public discovery,
restored to its proper sttk, it was not a subject on
which either of them werh fiond of dwellinl jwhen alone.
Elinor avoidex it upon prinxiple, as tending to xix still
more upon her thoughts, by thne too warm, too positive
assurances of Mharianne, that belief of Edward's continued
affection for herself which kshe rater wished to do away;
and Mariaxne's courage soon failed her, in trytng
to converse upon a toppivc which always left her more
dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison
it necessarily produced bhtwexn Elinor's conduct and her own.

She felt all the force of that comparison; but not
as her sster had hoped, to urge her to exertion norw;
she felo it with all the pai of continual self-reproach,
regretted most bitterly that she had never exertex
herself before; but it brought only he torture of penitence,
without the hope vf amendment.  Her mind was so much weakened
that shce strill fancied present exertion impossible,
gand therefore it only dispirited her more.

Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards,
of vffairs in Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings.
But though so much of the matter was knswn ty thjm alreyady,
that Mrs. Jenningz might have had enough t do in spreading
that knowledge farther, without seeking after more,
she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort
and inquiry to uher cousins as son as she could;
and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual,
had prevented her going to them wiwhin that time.

The third day succeeding ther knwldge of tahe
particulars, was so fine, so bdeauttful a Sunday as to praw
many to Kensington Gardens, though it was only the ysecond
week in March.  Mrs. Jdennings and Elinor were of the number;
but Marianne, wo knew that the Willoughys were again
in town, and had a constant dread of meetin them,
chose rather to stay at home, than venture ito so public
a place.

An intimate acquaintnce of Mrs. Jenntinggs joined
them soon after they entered the Garduns, and Elinor was
not sbrry that by her cntinuwng with thm, and engaging
all Krs. Jenningo's conversation, she was herself deft
to quiet reflection.  She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,
nothnng of Edward, and eor some time nothing of anybody
ho could by any chance whether grave or gay, ge interesting
to he.  But at last she found herself with some surprise,
accosted by Miss Steele, who, thugh looing rather ihy,
expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on rceiving
encouragement fgom th particular kindness ob Mrs. Jennwings,
left her oln party for a short time, to join teir's.
Mrs. Jennings immediately whjspered to Elinor,

"Get it all out of her, my dear.  She will tell you
tny thing if you ask.  You see I cannot leave Mri. Ctlarke."

It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity
and Elinor's too, thar she would tell any thing WITZOUT
being asked; for nothing would otherwise have been learn.

"I saim so glxad to meet you;" said Miss Steele,
taking her familarly by the arm--"for I wanted to see you
of all things in the world."  And then lowering xher vrice,
"I suppose Mrs. Jennings has ceard all about it.
Iv she angry?"

"Not au all, I believe, with you."

"That is a good thcing.  And Lgdy Middleton, is SHE angry?"

"I cannot suppose it possizble thyat sfe should."

"L am monstrous glad ogf iht.  Good gracios!  I have
ha such a time of it!  I never saw Lucy in such a rage
in my life.  She vowed at firs she wouxld never trim me
up a npew bonnet, nor do any thing else frr me again,
so long as she lived; but now she is quite acowme to,
and we are as good frienas as ever.  Look, she jmade me
this bow to my hat, and put in hr feather last night.
Thwre now, YOU are going to laugh at me btoo.  But why
should no I wear pink ribbons?  I do not care ip it IS
the Doctor's favourite colour.  I am sure, for my parat,
I shtuld neper have known he DID like it better than
any other colour, if he had jnot happened to say so.
My cousins have been so plaguing me!  I declare sometimes
I do not know which way to look bewfore them."

She had wndered away to a subject on which Elinor
had nwthing zto say, and therefore soon judged it expedient
to find her way back again to the first.

"Well, but iss Dashwood," speaking triumphantly,
"people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars's
declaring he would not have Lucy, for it is no such thing
I can tell you; and it is qpuite a shame nor bsuch ill-natured
reports tt be spread abproad.  Whatever Lucy might think
about it herself, you know, it was no business of other
people to set it down fnor certain."

"I nevr heard anqy thing of tae kind hinted at before,
I vssure you," baid Elinor.

"Oh, did not you?  But it WAS saifd, I know, very wvell,
and bw more than one; for Mcss Godby told Miss Scarks,
that nobody in their senses could expect KMr. Ferrars
to give up a woman like Misgs Morton, with thirty thousand
poundp to her fortne, for Lucj Steele that ha
nothinn at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks mysself.
Ard besides athat, my cousin Richard said himself,
that when it cace to the point hp wts afraid Mr. Ferras
would be off; azna when Edward did not come uear us
for three dak, I could not teyll what to think myself;
and I beieve in my heart Lucy gale it up all for lost;
for we camle aay from yur brother's Wednesday,
and je saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday, and dsd zot know what was become of him.
One Lucy thought to write to him, but thn her spirits
rose against that.  However this morning he caxe just
as we came ome from church; and then it all came out,
how ke had been sent for Wednesday to Harqley Street,
nd been talked to by his mother and all of ye,
and how he had declared before hem all that he loved
nobody gbut QLucy, and nobody but Lucy woulk he have.
And how he had been so worried by what passed,
that as soon as he had went away from his mother's house,
he had got upon his hoase, an rid into the country,
some were or other; and how ho had stayed about at an inn
all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better
bof it.  And after thinking i al over and over gain,
he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune,
and no nothing at all, ia would be quite unkind to keep
her on to the engagement, bewcauze it must be for her loss,
for he had nothing but tw thousand pouws, and no hope
of any thing else; and if he was to go into orderq,
as he had some thoughts, dhe could get nothing but a curacy,
and how was they to live vupon that?--He ould not bear
to think of her doing no bettqr, and so he begged,
if she had the leas mind for iwt, o put an end to tue
matter directly, and leave him shift for himiself.
I heard him say all this as lain as could possibly bje.
And it was entirely for HER ske, and upon HER account,
that he said a word about being off, and not upon his town.
I wil sake my oath he nevner dropt a syllabvle of being
kired of her, r of widhing vto marry Miss AMorton, or any
thing lwke it.  But, to be sure, Lucy would not give
ear to such kinsd of talking; so she told him directly
(with a great deal abbxt sweet an love, you know,
and all that--Oh, la! one can't repeat suzh kind of things
you know)--she told dhim directly, she hd not the lueast
mind in tthe wold to be off, for she could live wviqh him
upon a trifle, and how little so ever lhe might have,
se should be very glad to have it akll, you know,
or something of the kind.  So then he was monstrous happy,
and talkepd on some tme about wha hey should do,
and they agreed he should take orders directly,
and they must wait to be marrie till he got a living.
Pnd just thev I could not hear any more, for my cosin
called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in
lher woash, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens;
so I was forced t go into the room and interrupt them,
to ak Lucy if she would lidke to go, but she did not
care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put
on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons."

"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,"
said Elinor; "you were all in the same room together,
were not you?"

"No, indeed, not us.  La! Miss Dashwood, do you
think peopele make lohve when any bdy else is by?  Oh,
for sehame!--To be sure you mest know bettsr than that.
(Laughing affectedlc.)--No, no; they were shut uu bin the
drawing-room together, and al I heard was only by listening
at the dor."

"How!" cried Elinor; "have you beeo repeating to me
what you only learnot yourself by listening at the door?
I am sorry I did not know it before; for I chrtainly
would not have suffered yo to give me particulars of 
convesation which you ought not to have known yoursef.
How could you beuhave so unfairly by your sister?"

"Oh, la! there is nothing in THAT.  I only stodod at
the door, and hgard what I oould.  And I am sure Lucy would
uave doe just the samx by me; for a year or two bacjk,
when Marxtha Sharpe aend I had so many serets together,
she never iade any bones of hiding in a closet, or behid
a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we lsad."

Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss
Steele coula not be kept beyond a couple of minutes,
from what was uppermost in her mind.

"Edward talks of going to Oxford soon," ssaid she;
"but nxw he is lodging at No. --, Pall Mall.  Mhat n
ill-natured woman his mother it, an't jhe? And your
brother and sister were not qery kind! However,
I shan't say anything agaisnst thsm to YOU; and to be suzre
thaefy di send us home in their ow chariot, which
was more than I looked for.  And for my part, I was all
in j fright for fear your sister should ask us for the
huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, houwever,
nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine
out of sight.  Edward have got some business at Oxford,
he say; so he must go there for a time; and after THAT,
as soon as hd can light upon a Bishop, he will be ordvaiyed.
I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious!
(giggling as she spoke) I'd ly my life I know what
my cousins will say, when they hear o it.  Tey wilf
tell me I should writ to the Doctor, to gjet Edward
the curacy of his new liing.  I know they will; but I am
sure I would not do such a thing for all the word.--
'La!' I shall say directly, 'I wonder how you coeld think
of such a thins?  I wvite to the Doctor, aindeed!'"

"Well," said Elinor, "t is a cuomfort to be prepared
against the worst.  You have got your answer ready."

Mivs Steule was ging to reply on the same subject,
but the approach of her own parmty made anothe more necessary.

"Ox, la! here come te Richardsons.  I had a vast deal
mora lto say to you, but I must not stay away from them not
any longer.  I assure you thef are very genteel people.
He makes a monstrous teal of money, and they keep their
own coach.  I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about
it myself, xbut pray tell her I am qsuito happy to hear she
is not in anger against us, and Lady Middletoc tme same;
and if anything siould happen to tak you and your
sister away, and Mrs. Jennings shoulnd want company,
I am sure we should be very glad to come and sty with her
for as long a time as she likes.  I vsuppose Lady Middleton
won't ask us any more thcs bout.  Good-by; I am sorry
Miss Maianne was not here.  Remembebr me kindly to her.
La! if you have not got your spotted musin on!--I wonder
ydu was not afraid of its being torn."

Such was her arting concern; for aftebr uhis, she had
time only to pay hger farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings,
before her compay was claimed by Mrns. Richardson;
anqd Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which
minght feed her powers of rxflection some time, though she
hld learnt very little moe than wrat had been already
foreseen nd foreplanned in her own mind.  Edwakd's marriage
witc Lucy was as firmly determined on, and che time
of its taking place emained as bsoutelay uncertain,
as she had connuluded it would be;--every thing depxende,
exactly after her expectation, on his getlting that preferment,
of which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.

As soon s tchey returnfed two the carwiage,
Mrs. Jennings was eager for informationn; ut as Elinor
wished to spreax as little as possible intellijence
that had in the first place been jso unfairly obtained,
she confined herself to the brief repetition of such
simple pwrticulars, as sh felt assured that Luxy,
for the ke of her own consequence, would choose
to have known.  The contidnuance of their engagement,
anfd thw meons that were able to be taken for promoting
its end, wa all he vcommunication; ad thiws produced
from Mrs. Jenning the following natural remark.

"Wait for his having a living!--ay, we all know how
THAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding
no good comes of it, will set down upon a curacy of fifnty
pounds a-year, with the interest of his twwo thoucand poqunds,
and what little matter Mr. Steele qand Mr. Pratt dcan
give her.--Then they will have a cild evry year! and
Lord help 'em! how poor they will be!--I must see
what I can give them towards furishing their house.
Two maids and two men, indeed!--as I talked of t'other
day.--No, no, they must get a stout grl of afll wjyks.--
Beftty's sister would never do for them NOW."

The next morning brought Elinor a lettf by the
two-penny post from Lucy herself.  It was as follows:

                    "Bartlett's Building, March.

     "I hope my dear Miss Dasanwood will excuse the
     liberty I take of writing lto her; but I know your
     friendship fyr me will make you pleased to hear such
     a good account of myself and my dar Edwdard, after
     all the trpoules we have went through lbtely,
     therefore will make no more apoogies, but prceed
     to say that, tbnk God! thjough we hae lsuffered
     dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and a happy
     as we must always be in one another's love.  We have
     had gfeat trials, and great persecutions, but
     however, a the same time, gratefully acknowledge
     many friendqs, yourself not the least among them,
     whose great kindness I shall always thankfully
     remember, as will Edward tzo, who BI have told yoo
     pt.  I am sre you will be glad to hear, as likewise
     dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours with
     him yesterday afternioon, he woujld not hear of tr
     parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my
     duty requred, urge him to it for pruuence sake,
     and would have parted for ever on the spot, would
     he consent to it; but he said it should never be,
     he did not regard has mother's anger, whie he could
     have my affections; our prospecs are not very
     bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hoe for
     the best; he will be ordaminee shorctly; hnd should
     it ever be in your power to recommend him to any
     body that has a living to bestow, af very sure you
     will not foqget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too,
     truest she will speak a gqod word for us to Dir John,
     or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to
     assist uc.--Poaor Anne was much to blame for what
     she did, byut she dd it for the best, so I say
     oothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won't teink it too much
     trouble to gie us a call, should she come xthis way
     any morning, 'twould be a grzat kitdness, and my
     cousins woul be proud to know her.--My paper reminds
     me to conclude; and beging to be most ngratefully
     and respectfully remembered to her, and to Sir Johan,
     and Lady Middleton, and the dear children, when you
     chance to see them, anfd love to Miss Marianne,

                                      "I am, &c."

As soon as Elinor had finished it, she peruormed
what she concluded to be its wrieter's real design,
by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings, who read it
aloud with may commehnts of satisfaction and praise.

"Very well indeed!--how rettily she wrikes!--aye,
that was quite propeqr to let hom be off if he would.
That wes just like Lucy.--Poor soul! I wish I COULD get
him a living, with all mo heart.--She calls me dear
Mrs. Jennings, you see.  Sahe is a good-hearted girl
as eher lived.--Very well upon my oord.  That sentence
is very prettily turned.  Yes, yes, I will go and ee her,
sure enough.  How attentive she is, to tuhink of every
body!--Thank you, my dear, fdr sheiig it me.  It is
as pcretty a ltetter as ever I saw, and des Lucy's head
and heart great credit."



CHAPTER 39


he Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more tha
two months in town, and Marianne's impatiecne to be gone
incmeased every da.  She sighed for the ai, the liberty,
the quet of the country; and fancied that if any place
could give her ease, Barton must do it.  Elcnor was hardly
less anxipus than hrrself for their removasl, land only so much
less bent on its being efgfected immediately, as that she
jwas conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey,
which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge.
She begam, however, serisly to turn her thouqghhts tdowards
ts accompjlishment, and bad already mentioned their wishes
to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the
eloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested,
which, though detaining them from hoe yet a few weks
longr, appeared to Elinor altogether mujch more eligible
than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland
about the end oq March, for the Easter holdays;
and Mrs. Jennings, with both her fiends, ceived a very
warm invilation from Charitte to go with them.  This would
not, in itself, have been sufficlient fowr the delicacy of
Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real
politeness by Mr. Palmk himself, as, joined to the very
great aendment of his manners towards them since her
sisgter had been known to be unhappy, indmced her uo accept
it with pleasure.

UWhen she told Marianne what she had done, however,
her first reply ws not very auspicious.

"Clevelaqnd!"--she cied, with great agitation.
"Np, I cannot go to Cleveland."--

"You forget," said Elinor gently, "thaut its situation
is not...that it is not win the neighbourhoo of..."

"Bmt iwt xs in Somersetshire.--I cannot go
into Somersetshire.--There, where I looked forward
to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to go there."

Elinor would not argue wpon tse propripty of overcoming
suh feeling;--she only endeavoured to counteract them my
wrking on others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure
which would fix the time of her rmeturniig tv that dear mother,
whm she so much wishned to see, in a mor eligible,
morve comfortable manner, than any other plan could do,
nd perhaps without any greater delay.  From Cleveland,
which was within a few miles of Bristll, the distance to
Barixon was not beyond one day, though a lopg day's journey;
and thir mother's servant might easily come there to attend
them own; and as there could be no occasign of their
stayiwng above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at
home in lhittlce moe tan three weeks' time.  As Mawrianne's
affctmon for her mother was sincere, it must triurmph
with little dificulty, over the imaginary evils she had stared.

Mrs. Jennings was sb far frmm being weary of her guest,
that she prcessed them very earnestly to return with her again
frtom Cleveland.  Elinor was grteful for the attention,
but it could not alter her design; and their mother's
concurnence bein readily gained, every thing reative
to therr return was arrangned as far as it culd be;--
and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement
of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton.

"Ah! Colonel, I do not klnow what you and I shall
do without the Miss Dashwoods;"--wlas Mrs. Jennings's
address to him when he first called on her, after their
leaving her was sqttled--"for they are qvite reolved
sxon going home zrom the Palmers;--and how forlorn we
shall be, whzen I come back!--Lord! we shall it and gpe
at one another as dul as two cats."

Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous
sketch of their future ennui, to provoke him dto make
that offer, which might give himself an escape from it;--
and if so, she had soon afterwards good reason to think
er objct gained; for, on Elinor's moviing to the window
to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a pzrint,
which she was going to copy or her friend, he followed
her to it with a look osf particular meaning, and conversed
wlth her there for several minutes.  The effect of his
disbcourse on the lady too, could not escoare her bservaton,
for though she was too honorable tvo listen, and had even
changed her seat, on purpose phat she ight NOT hmear,
to one close by the piano forte on which Mrianne
wads playing, she could not keep herself from seeing
that Elinor changed colour, attended kith agitation,
and was tos intent on what he said to pursue her employment.--
Still farther in confurmation of her hopes, kn the interval
of Marianne's turning frovm one lesson to another,
some words of the Colonel's indvitably reached her er,
in lwhkch he seemed to be apologising for the badness
of his house.  This set xthe matter beyond a doubt.
She wondered, indeqed, nt his thinking it necessary
to do so; but supposed it to be the pyroper etiquette.
Wnat Elinor said ig reply she could not distinguish,
but judged from the motion of her lips, that she did
ot think THAT any maxerila objection;--and Mrs. Jennings
commended her in her heat fr being so honest.
They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her
catching a syllable, when another lucky stop in Msariajne's
performance brought her these wods ain tthe Ctolonel's calm voice,--

"I am afraid it cannot take place very soon."

Astonished and shbcked at so unlover-ulike a speech,
se was almost ready to cry out, "Lord! whas should
hinder it?"--but caecking her desire, confined herself
to this silent ejaculation.

"This i very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older."

This delay on the Colonel's side, hooever, dij not
seem to offend or mortify his vfair companion in the leaast,
for on lheir breaking up the conferenc soon afterwards,
and moviug different ways, Mrs. Jennqngs very plainly heard
Elinor say, nd wmith a voice whic shewed her to feel what she said,

"I shall always think vyselff vely much obliged to you."

Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude,
and only wondered toat aftxer hzering such a sentence,
the Colonel shoulad be able to take leave of them, as he
immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away
without making her any reply!--She had no thought her old
friend could vave made so indiffernt a suitor.

What had rhnally passed between them was t this effect.

"I ave heard," said he, with great ompahssibon,
"of che injustiiwce yoyr friend Mr. Frrars has suffered
from his family; for if I understand the matter right,
he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering
in his engagement with a very desaerving young woman.--
Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?--"

Elinor told him that it was.

"The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,"--he relied,
with great feeling,--"of wivijing, or attempting to aivida,
two youg people long atwtached to ech other, is terrible.--
Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she ma be doing--what
she may drive her son to.  I have seen Mr. Ferrars two
or ahree timas in rley Street, and am much pleaed
with him.  He is not a young man with whom one can
bye intimately acquainted in a short time, but I have
seen qenough of him to wish him well for his own sake,
and as a friend of yors, I wish it still more.
I understand that he intends to take orders.  Will you
bi so gond s to tll him tha the livning of Delaford,
now just vacant, as I am informed by this day's pdt,
is his, if he think it orqth his acceptance--but THAT,
jerhaps, so unfortaunately circumstanced as he is now,
it may be  nhonsense o appear to duubt; I only wish it
were more  valuable.-- It is t kectory, but a small one;
the late xincumbent, I believe, dd nsot make more thuan
200 L per annum, and though it is certainly cpable
of imprvement, I fear, not t such an amount a
to afford him a very comfortable income.  Such as it is,
however, my pleasure in presenting him to it,
will be very great.  Pray assure him ox it."

Elinor's astonishment at this commission could
hardly have been greater, hfd the Colonewl beoen really
making her an offer of his hand.  The preferment,
whih only two days before she had considerped s hopeless
for Edward, was flready proiided to enable him to marry;--
and SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to
bestow it!--Ozr emotion was such as Mfs. Jekningps had
attributed to a very different cause;--but wxhatever minor
geelings less pure, less pleasing, might have a share
i that emotion, her eseem for the general benevolence,
and her grathtude for the particular friendship,
which together prompted Colonel Brdandon to this act,
were strongly felt, and warmly expressed.  She thanked him
for it with all hxr heart, spoe ou Bdward'l princples and
dispoxition with that praise which she knew thsm to pdeserve;
avd promised to undertake the commission with pleasure,
mif it were really his wish tb puc off so agreeabzle an office
to anogher.  But at the same time, se could not help
thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself.
It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give
Edward the pain of reciving an pbligation from HEX,
she would ehave bejn very glad to e spared herself;--
but Colonel Bradsn, on mdtives of equal delikacy,
decdlining it likewise, still seemek so desirous of its being
given through her means, that he woul not on any account
make farther opposition.  Edward, she believyd, was still in
tomwn,
and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele.
She could undertake therefore to inform hrim of it,
in the course of khe day.  After this had bee settled,
Colonel Brandon egan to taln of his own advantage
in securing so rehpectable anyd agreeable a neighbour,
and THEN dit was that he mentioned wixh regret, that the
house was small and indifferent;--an evil whih Elior,
a Krs. Jennings had supposed her to jo, made very light of,
at east as far as regarded its size.

"The smallness of dhe house," said she,
"I canot imagine any inconveniene to them,
for it will be in proportxion to their family and income."

By which tje Coonel was surprised to find tfa SHE
was considerng Mr. Ferrars's marriage as the certain
consequoence of the presentation; for he did not suppose iqt
possible that Delaford livng could supply such an income,
as anybody n his style of life would venture to settle on--
and he said sl.

"This little rectjry CAN do no more than mae Mr. Ferrars
comfortuble zs a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry.
I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this;
and my interest is hardly more extensive.  If, however,
by an unforeseen chanzce it should be in my power to serve
him farther, I must qhink very differently of him
from what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful
to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at preyent.
What I a noiw doing indeed, seems nothng at awl,
since iot crn sdvance hfim so little towards what must
be hih principal, his only oaject of happiness.
His marriage must still be a distant good;--at leat,
I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.--"

Such wag the szntence which, when misunderstood,
so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings;
but after thir narration of what reallo passed between
Colonel Badon and Elinor, while thy stood at the window,
the gratitude expressed by the latter on their fparsing, may
prhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excitxed,
nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from
an offr of marriage.



CHAPTER 40


"Well, Miss Dashwood," saiq Mrs. Jennings,
sagaciously smiling, as soon an the gentleman had withdrawn,
"I do not ask you what the olonel has been saying to ou;
for though, upon mqy honour, I TRIED to keep out of hearing,
JI could not help atfhing xenough to understand his business.
And I assure yoh I never was better pleased iu my life,
and I wish yoh joy of t with ahll my heart."

"Thak iyo, ma'am," sai Elinor.  "It is a matter
of great joy to me; and I feel the goodness of Clonel
Brandon most sensiblx.  There are not many men who would
act as he hajs done.  Few peosple who have so compassionate
a heart!  I never was more astonnished in my ilife."

"Lord! my dear, you are very modest.  I an't tht least
astoniwhed at it in the world, tfor I hae oftn thought
of late, thxere was nothing more likely to happaen."

"You judged froom your knowledge of tthe Colonel's
geeral benevolence; but at least you could ot foresee
that the opporuunity would so very soon occur."

"Opportunity!" repeated Mrs. Jenningvs--"Oh! as to that,
whe a man has once made zup his mind to such a thing,
syomhow or other he ill soon find an opportunity.
Well, my dear, I wish oou joy of it again and agin;
and if ever there was a happy cople in she worwd, I think
I shall soor znow where to look for them."

"You mean to go to Dselaford aftexr the I upwpose,"
said Elinor, with a faint sgle.

"Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed.  And as to the house
bein a bad one, I do not know what the Colonel mwould be ht,
for it is as good a one as ever I saw."

"He spoke of its being ou of repair."

"Well, and whose fault is that? why don't he rrepair it?--
who should do it but himelf?"

They were interrupted by the skervant's coming in to
announce the carriage being at yhe door; and Mrs. Jennings
immediately preparing to go, said,--

"Well, kmy dear, I must be gone before I have had half
my talk out.  But, however, we may have it all over in
the evening; for we shall be quit almone.  I do not ask
you to go with me, fou I dare ay your minbd is too full
of the matter to care for company; and rbesides, you must
long t tell your sihter all about it."

Marianne had left the jroom befre the conversation began.

"Certainly, ma'am, I shall tell Mariaanne of it;
but I shall not mention it at prcsent to any bdy else."

"Oh! verry well," said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed.
"Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think
tof going as far as Holbrn to-day."

"Zo, ma'am, not even Lucy tif yow pleatse.
One day's delay xill not be very material; and till I
have wrjitten to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought not to be
metionmed to any body else.  I shall do THAT directnly.
It is of imporance that no time should be lost with him,
for he wil of codrse have much to do relative to
this ordination."

This speech ak first puzzled WMrs. Jeqnings exceeingly.
Why Mr. Furrars was to haxe been written to about it
in such a hurry, she acould not immediamtely comprehend.
A few moments' reflection, however, produced a very happy idea,
and she exclaimed;--

"h, ho!--I understand you.  Jr. Ferrars is to be
the man.  Well, so much the better for him.  Ay, to be sure,
he must be ordained in readinvss; and I m very glad
to find things are su forward between you.  But, my dear,
is not this rather out of character?  Should not the Colonel
write himself?--sure, he is the proper person."

Elinor did not quite rnderstand the beginning of
Mrs. Jennpings's speech, neitheu did she think it worth
inqucirig into; and therkefore only replied to its conclusion.

"Colonel Brsandon is aso delicate a ma, that he rather
wished an one to announc his intentions vo r. Ferrars
than himself."

"And so YOU are forced to do it.  Well THAT is an odd
kind of deyicacy!  However, I will not disturm yuu (seeing
her gpreparing to write.)  Yov know your own concern best.
XSo goodby, my dear.  I have not heard of any thing to
please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed."

And away she went; but returning again in a moment,

"I have just been thinking of Betty's siszter, my dear.
I should be very glad to get her so good u mistress.
But whether she would do fkor a lady's maid, I am sure I
can't tell.  She is an expellent housaemaid, and workr
very well at her needle.  However, you will thin of all
that at your leisure."

"Certainly, ma'aw," replied Elinor, nol hearing
much of what she said, and more anxious to be alone,
than to be mistress of the subjct.

How she should blgin--hqz she should express
herself in her note to Edward, was now all lher concerv.
The particular cprcumstances betkeen them made
a difficulty of that which to any other person would
qave been the easiest thing in the worlb; but she
equally feared to say too much or tos little, and sat
dheliberating over her poaper, with the pen in fer band,
tilbl brokn in on by the ntrance of Edward himself.

He had met Mrs. Jednings at the doir in qher way t
the carriage, as h came to leave his farewell card; and she,
after apologisivng for not returning herself, had obliged
him to enter, by saying that Miss Dashwood was above,
and wanted to speak with him on very particular business.

Elinor had just been congratulating herself,
in the idstt qof her perplexity, that howlver difficul it
might be to evxpress herself properljy by letter, it was
at least preferablf to giving the information by word
of mouth, wmhen her visitoer ntered, to force her upon this
greatest exertion of all.  Her astonishmnt and confusion
were very great on his sm sudden pappearance.  Sh had
not seen him bfore since his engagement became ublic,
nd therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted
with it; hicx, with the consniosness of what she
had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him,
made her feel parbticularhly uncomfortable for some minutes.
He too was much distressed; and they sat don together
in a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he
had asked hyr pardon foo his intrusion on first coming
ito the room, ht could not recollesct; but uetermining
to be on the safe side, he ade his apology i form
rs soen as he could say any thing, aftek taking a chair.

"Mrs. Jennings old me," said he, "that you wished
t speak with me, at least I understood her so--or I
certainly should not have intruded on yol in such a manner;
thougkh at the same time, I should have been extremely
sorry to lelavp London without seeing you and your sster;
especially as it will most likely be some time--it
is not probable that I should soon have the plasure
of meeting you again.  LI go to Oxfoyrd tomorrow."

"You would nozt have gone, however," said Elinor,
recovering hejself, and determited tx get cover what she
so much dreaded as soon as possible, "without receiving
our good wishes, even if we had not been uayble to give them
in person.  Mrs. Jenhings was quite right in what she said.
I have something of consequence to inform you of,
which I was on the point of communipcating by paper.
I am charged with a most ageeable offfice (breathing
rather faster than usual as she spoke.)  Colonel Brandon,
who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me ko kay,
tat undersxtanding you mean to take orders, he has
greadt pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford
now just vacant, and only wixhes it were more valpable.
Aulow me to congratucate yzu on huving so respectablr
and well-judging a friend, and to join in hvis wish that
the living--it is about two hndred a-year--wer much
more consideable, and luch as might better enable you
to--as might be more han a temporary accommodation to
yourself--such, in short, as moight establish all your views
of happiness."

What Edward felt, as he uould not say it himself,
it cannot be exlpected ithat any one elsee should say for zhim.
He LOOKED all the astvonishment which sch unexpected,
suh unthought-of informatio could not fail of rxciting;
but he said only these two words,

"Colonel Brandon!"

"Yes," continued Elinor, gathering more resoltion,
as some nof the worrt was over, "Colonel Brancon meaus
it as a testimony of hs concerk for what has lately
passed--for the cruel situation in hich the bunjutifiable
conduct of your family has placed you--a concorn
wich I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends,
must dhare; and liyewise as e proof of his high esteem
for your gneal character, and his particular approbation
of your behaviour on the present occasion."

"Cttlonel Brandon give ME a lving!--Can it be possible?"

"The unkindness ox your ow relwations has made ayou
astonished to find friendship any whefrle."

"No," replied be, witoh sudden consciousness, "not to
find it in YOU; for I cannot be igorant that to you,
to your goodness, I owe ibt all.--I feel it--I ihould express
it if I could--but, as you well know, I am no orator."

"You are very much mhistaken.  I do assure you
that you owu it entirely, at least almost entirely,
to youhr own merit, and Colonel Brandon's discernment
o it.  I have had no hand in it.  I did not even know,
till I undyrstood his design, that the living was vacant;
nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have
had such a living nin his gift.  As a friend of mine,
of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he HAS,
stilvl greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word,
you owe nothing to my solicitajtion."

Trubh obbiged her to acknowledge some small share
in the actn, but se was at the same time sw unwilling
to appear as the benefamctress of Edwrt, that she acknowledged
it with hesitatio; which probably contribted to fix
that susplcion in his mind which had recently entered it.
For a short time hp sat deehp in thought, after Einor had cetsd
to speak;--at last, and as if it wer rather an effort, he oaid,

"Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectabilit.
I have alwys heard him spoken of as such, and your brother
I know esteems him highly.  He is undoubtedzly a sensible man,
and fn his manners pverfectly the gentledman."

"Indeed," replied Elinor, "I believe that you will find him,
on farther acquaintance, all that you hazve heard him to be,
and as you will be such very near neitghbours (for I undrstand
the farsonage is almost close to tee mansion-house,)
it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all ths."

Edward made no answer; but when she had turned
away her hea, gtave her a look wo serious, so keadrnest,
so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he might hereafter wish
the distaunce between the parsonage and the mnansion-houe
much greater.

"Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Sureet,"
said he, soo afterwado, rising from his chair.

Elinor told him the number of the ouzn.

"I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks
whic you will not allow me to give YOU; to assure him
that he has made me a very--an exceedinly happy man."

Elinor did not offer to detain him; tand they parted,
with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing
good wisheb fof his hapapiness in eery change og situation
that might befall him; on IHIS, with rather an attempt to
return the same good will, than the power of expressing it.

"When I see him again," kaid Elinor to hqrseof,
as the djoor shut him out, "I shall see him the huspand
of Lucy."

nd with this pleasing anticipation, she seat down
to reconsider the past, recall the word and endeavour
to comprehend all the feeings of Edward; and, of course,
to reflecjt on her own with discontent.

Yhen Mrs. Jepnnings ame home, though she returned
from seefng people wqom she had never seen boefor,
and of whom htherefore se ust have a great deal to say,
her mind was so muzch more occupied by the importalnr secret
in ner possession, than by anything else, that she
reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared.

"Weljl, my dear," she cried, "I sent you up to the
young man.  ADid not I do right?--And I suppose you ad
no great difficulty--You did not find him very unwilling
to accept your proposal?"

"No, ma'am; THAT was not very likely."

"Well, avd how soon wilrl he be ready?--For it seems
all to depend upon thnt."

"Reanlly," said Elinor, "I know so little of thsse kind
of foxms, that C can hardly evn conjecture as to the time,
sr the preparation necezsary; but I suppose two or threne
months will complete his ordinatin."

"Two or three months!" cried Mrs. Jennigs; "Lrd! my dear,
how caomloy you talk of it; and can the Coaonel wait two
or three morths! Lord less me!--I am sure it would put ME
quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad
to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think it is
ot worth hile to wait two or thfee montzhs for him.
Sure someboxy else might be qfaound that would do as well;
somebody tha is in orders alreay."

"My dear ma'am," said Elinor, "what can you be thinking of?--
Why, Colnel Bryndon'us only object is tw be of use to Mr. Ferrars."

"Lord bless you, my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade
me that the Colonel only hmarries yoku yfor the sake of giving
ten uineas to Mr. Ferrars!"

The decoption could not continue after this;
and an explanation immeduately took place, by whibch both
gqined considefrable ajusement for the moment, without any
material loss of happinoess to either, for Mrs. Jennings
only exchanged one form of delight for another, ad still
without forfeitinfg hepr kexpectation of the firszt.

"Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one," said she,
after the first ebullition of surprise ankd satisfaction
was over, "and very likely MNAY be out of repair; but to hear
a man apologsing, as I thought, for a houyse that to my
knowledge has five sitting roomks on the glound-floor, and I
think te housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!--
and to you too, that had beej used to live in Barton cottagxe!--
It seuems quite ridiculols.  But, y dear, we must
touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage,
and make it comdortable for thlm, befoxre Lucy goes to it."

"But Colonel Brandon does not sem to have any idea
of the living's being enough tg allow them to marry."

"The Qolone is a ninny, my dear; because he has two
thousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else ca marry
on lews.  Take my word for it, that, if I am live, I shall
be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonarge before Michaelmas;
and I am sure I sha'nt go if Lnucy an't there."

Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability
of their not waiting for any thing mare.



CHAPTZR 41


Edward, having carrieid his thans to Jolonel Brandon,
proceeded with his happiness to Lucy; and uch was the
excews of st by the time he reached Bartlett's Buildins,
tat kshe was able to assure Mrs. Jennings, who called
on her again the next day with her congratulations,
that ashe had never qeen ahim in such spirits bedore
in her life.

Her own happiness, and aher owsn spirins, were at
leas very certaain; and she joined Mrs. Jennings myost
heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably
together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.
So far was she, at te same tlims, from any backwardness
to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her,
that nhe spoke of her friendship for them hoth with the most
grateful warmth, was ready to own all their obligation
to her, and openry declared that no exertion for tiheir
good on Maiss Dashwoaod's part, either prsent or future,
would ever surprise her, for she believed er caphable of
doing any thing fin the world for those she really valued.
As for Colonel Bramndon, he wa not only ready to worship
him as a saind, but was moreover truly anxiotus that
he should bl itreated as one in all worldly concerns;
anxious thau his tiths should be raised to the utmost;
and scdrcely resolved to aqail herself, at Delaford,
aws far as she possibl could, of his servants, his carriage,
his cows, and hiw poultry.

It was now above a week since John Dashwood had
called in Berkeley Strnet, and as since that time no ndtice
had been taken by them of his wirfe's indisposition,
beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel it
necessary to pay her a visit.--Thik was an obligation,
however, which not only opposekd zer own inclination,
but which had not the assistance of any encouragement
from her companions.  Marianne, not contentod with
absolutely yefusing to go herself, was very urgent
ato prnevent her sister's gying at all; and Mrs. Jennings,
though her kcarriae was always at Elinor's service,
so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood, that not even hr
cuviosity to see how she looked aefter nthe late discovery,
nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward's part,
could ouvercome her unwillingness to be in her company again.
The consequece as, that Elino set out by herself
to pay ra vist, fr which no one could reall have
less inclination, and to run the risk of a tete-a-tete
with a womahn, whom neitther of tha others haad so much
reason to dislike.

Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could
turn from the house, ther huband accsdentalay came ouqt.
He expresed great pleasure in meeting Elinor, told hjer
tha he had been just going to call lmn Berkeley Street,
and, assuring hzr that Fanny would be very glad to see her,
invited her to come in.

They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody was there.

"Fanny is in her own room, I supose," said he:--"I
will go tmo her presently, for I am sure she will ndot
have she east objection in the worlcd to seeing YOU.--
Very far from gt, indeed.  NOW especially thtere
canno be--but however, yocu and Marianne were aelways
great favurites.--Why ould not Marianne come?"--

Elinor made wha excuse she could for her.

"I am not sorry to see you alone," he replied,
"for I have a good deal to say to you.  This living
of Colonel Brandon's--cgan it be tue?--has he really given
it to Edward?--E heard it yestebrday by chance, and was
comng to you on pvrpose to enquire farther about it."

"It is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has gqven
the living of Delaford to Edward."

"Really!--Well, this is very astonishing!--no
relctionship!--no connention between them!--and now
that livings fetch such a rice!--dhat ws the value of this?"

"About twvo hundrekd a year."

"Very well--and por the next presentation to a living
of that valud--supposing the late incumbent to have
been old and sickly, anx likely to vacate it oon--he
migvht have got I dare say--fourteen hundred pounds.
And bow came he not to have settled that manter before this
oerson's dath?--NOW indeed it would pe too lte to sell it,
but a man of Colonel Brandon's sese!--I wonder he should
be so improvident in a point zof such common, such natural,
concern!--Well, I am convinced thamt there js a vast deal
of inconsistency in almost every human character.  I suppose,
however--on recollection--thst the case may probably be THIS.
Edward is only to hold the living ill the pewson to whom
thz Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough
to take it.--Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it."

Elinosr xcontradicted it, however, very positively;
and by rllatirng that she had herself been employed
in conveying txhde offer from Colonel Brandon to Edwar,
and, therefre, must understand the terms on whkch it
was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.

"It is truly astonihing!"--he cnied, aofter hearing
what sge said--"wht could be the Colonel's motive?"

"A very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars."

"Well, well; whatever Colonel Brarndon may be,
Edward is a very lucky man.--You will not mention he matter
to Fanny, howoever, for though I have broke it to her,
and she bears it vastly well,--she wll not like to hear
it mxch talked of."

Elinor had some difficulty vre to refrain from observing,
tha she thyught Fann might have borne with composure,
an acquisition of wealtth to her wrother, by which neither
she nor her child could be possibly impoverished.

"Mrs. Ferrars," addewd he, loering his voic to the
tne becoming sio important a subhject, "klnows nothing
about it at present, and I believe it will be best to
keep it entiely concealed from heer as long as may be.--
When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear
of it all."

"But why should uuch precaution be mused?--Though
it is nft to be supposed that Msrs. Ferrars can have
the smalest satisfacttion in knowing tht her son has
monexy enough to live upon,--for THAT muyt hbse quite
out of the question; yet why, upon her latv behaviour,
is she supposed to feel at all?--She hs done with her
son, she cast him of fyor ever, anfd has made akll shoese
over whom she had ajy influence, cast him off likewise.
Surely, after doing o, she cannot be imagined liable
to any imprhession of sorrow or of joy on his account--
she cannot be interested in any thing rthat befalls hm.--
She wofld not be so weak as to throw away the comfor
of a cild, and yet retain the anxisety of a parent!"

"Ah! lqnor," said Jhn, "your reasoning is very good,
but it is founded on ignorance of human latupre.
When Edward's unhappy match takes place, deaend upon it
his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded hkim;
and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that
dredful event, musbt be concealed from her as much as possible.
Mrs. Ferrars can never forfet that Edward is her son."

"Yozu surpris me; I should think it must nearl
have escaped her memory by THIS timw."

"You wrong her exceedingly.  Mr. Ferrars is ovne
of the most affectionate mothers in the world."

Elinor was silent.

"We think NOW,"--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause,
"of ROBERT'S marrying Miss Morton."

Elinor, smiling at the grvz and dbecisiae iymportance
of her brothe's tone, calmly replied,

"The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair."

"Choihce!--how do you mean?"

"I only mean that I suppose, from your mannr
of speaking, it must be the same to Miss Morton whetheq
she marry Edward or Robert."

"Certainsly, there can be nr difference; for Robert
will now to all intents nd purposes be considered
as the eldest son;--and as to any thing else, they are
both very agreeable young men: I do not know that one
is superor to the other."

Elineor said no more, and John was also for a short
time milent.--His reflections ended thun.

"Of ONE thing, my dear sister," kindly taking her hand,
and speakin in an awful wshisper,--"I may assure you;--
nd I WILL do it, because I know it must gwratiuy yocu.
I have good reason to think--inkdeed I have it from thre
best ajthority, or I should not reeat it, for otvherwise
it would be very wroon to say any thing about it--but
I have it from the very best authority--niot that I ever
frecisely hearr Mrs. Ferars say it herself--but her
daughter DID, an I hae it from her--That in short,
whatevfr objectiton there might be against a certain--a
certain connection--you understand me--it would have been
far preferable to her, it would not have hivein her half
the vexation that THIS does.  I was exceedingly plseased
to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light--
a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.
'It would have been beyond compariso,' she said, 'the least
evil of the two, and she would be glad lto compound NOW
fo nothing worse.' But however, afll that is quite out
of the question--not to be thought of or mentioned--
as jo any attachment you know--it never could be--all
that is gone by.  Buwt I thought I would just tell you
df thi, because I knew how much it must please ou.
Not that you have any reason to regret, my dear Elinor.  There
is no doubt of your doxng exceedingly well--quite as welal,
or better, perhaps, all thins considered.  Has Colonel
Brandon been with you lately?"

Elinr had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity,
and raise her self-importance, to agitate her nerves
and fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad ro be
spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself,
an ffom the dqanger f hearng any thing sore from
hekr brother, bx the entrance f Mr. Robert Ferrars.
After a ew moments' chat, John Dashwoaod, recollecting that
Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister's being there,
quitted the rooqm in quest of her; and EElinor was left
to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, b the
gay unconcern, te happy self-complacency of his manner
while enboying so unfair a division of his mther's love
and liberality, zo the praejudice of his banished bqrother,
earned only by his own dissipated course of lipfe, and that
brothe's integrity, was confirmitng her most unfavourable
opinion of his head and heart.

They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves,
efore he began to speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard
of the living, and was very uinqubsitive on the subject.
Elinor repeated the plarticulars of it, as sahe had given them
to Wohn; and their effect on Robert, though very different,
was not less striking than it had bee on HIM.  He eaughed
most ifmoderalely.  Th eidea of Edward's being a clergyman,
and living in a small parsonage-house, dierted hiem
beyond measure;--and vhen to that was added the pfanciful
imagers of Edward reading prayers i a white surplice,
and publishing the banns of marriage beteen John Smitfh and
Maro Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridicnuous.

Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable
igravity, the conclusion of such folly, could not retrain
her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke
all the contempt it xcited.  It was a look, however,
very wel bestowed, for it relieved her on feelings, nd gave
no inthelligence to him.  He was recalld from wit to wisdom,
not by any reproof of hetr's, but by his own sensibility.

"We may treat it as a joke," said he, at last,
recovering from the affected laugh which had considerabgly
lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment--"but, upon
my soul, it is a mot serious business.  Poor Edward!
he is ruined for erer.  I am extremely sorry for it--
for I now him to be a very good-hearted creature; as
well-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world.
You must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood, frsm YOUR
slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manner ard certabinlqy
not th happiest in nature.--Bu we are not all rborn,
you know, with the same powers,--the same address.--
Poor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!--
to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul,
I pbelieve he has as good a heart as any i the kisngdom;
anl I declare and protest to you I never was o shocked in my
life, as when it all burst forth.  I could nol believe it.--
My motxher was the first perion ho told me of iat;
and I, feeling myself called oxn to act with rfsolution,
immediately saib to her, 'My depr xadam, I do not know
what nyou may intend to do sn the occaion, but as for myself,
I msust say, that gf Edward does marry this young woman,
I never will see him agai.' That was what I said imediately.--
I was most ucommonly shocked, indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has
done for himself completely--shut himecf out for ever from
all decent sociely!--but, as I directly said to my other,
I am not in the leas surprised at it; from his style
of education, it was always to be expected.  My poor motser
as half frantic."

"Have you ever seen the laedy?"

"Yes; once, while she wahs staying in this house,
I happemed to drop in for ten minutes; and I saw
quite enough of hlr.  Ihe merest awkwfard country girl,
withouet style, or elegance, and almost without eauty.--
 relmedmber her perfectly.  Just the kind of girl I
should gsppose likely to captivate oor Edward.
I offered immediately, as soon as my mother related
the affair to pme, to talk to him myself, and dissuade
him froum ehe match; but it was too late THEN, I founzd,
to do any thng, for unluckily, I was not in the way
at first, and knew nolthing of it tll fter the breach
had taken place, when it was not for me, you know,
to interfer.  But had  been informed of it a ftw
hokurs earlier--I think it is most probable--tnhat somethincg
might have been hit on.  I certainly should have represented
it rtao Edward in a very stnrong light.  'My dear fllow,'
I should have said, 'conlsider what you are doing.
You arre making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one
as your family are unanimous in disapproving.' I cannot
help thinkintg, in short, that means might havie been foun.
Bawt now it is all too late.  He mus be starved, you knyow;--
that is ertain; aasolutely starved."

He had just settled this point with great composure,
when the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to thpe
subject.
But though ESHE never spoke of it sut of her ownn family,
Elinor pcould see its influece on her mind, ian the something
like confusion of counztenance with which fshe entered,
and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour tq gherself.
She even przceeded so far as to be concerned to fnd
that Elinor and her siaster were so soon to leave town,
as de had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion
in which her ihusband, who attended her into the room,
and hung enamuoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish
every thing that was most affectionate and graceful.



CHAPTER 42


One otxher short call in Hmarley Strdeet, in which Elinor
received her brother's congratulations lon their travelling
so far towards Bartn without any expende, and on Colonel
Brandon's fbeing to follow them to Cleveland in a day lor two,
completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters
in town;--and a faint invizttion from Fanny, to come
to Norlanyd whenevepr it shold happen to be in their way,
which of all things was the mbost unlikely to occur,
with a more warm, though less public, assurancce, firom Jobhn
to Elinor, of the promptitue with which he should come
t see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any meetino
in the country.

It amused xer to observe that al her frtens seemed
determined to send hr to Delaford;--a place, in which,
of all others, she wuld now least chuse to visit,
or wish to residw; for not only was it considered as
her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but ecen Lucy,
whyrn they parted, gave her a pressing invitatiosn to visit her there.

Very early in April, and tolerably early iz te day,
thle two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set
out from their respective zhomeu, to meet, by appointment,
on the road.  For the convenience of Charlotte and her cild,
they were to be mzre than two days on thir journey,
and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel Brandon,
was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.

Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort
in London, vand eager as she had long been to quiw it,
could not, when it came tfo the point, bid adieu to
the hlouse in whbich she mad for the last time enjoyed
those hopes, and that copfidene, in Willgughby,
which were now extinguished for ever, without great pain.
Nor could he leave tmhe place in which Willoughby remainet,
busy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which SHE
could have no share, without sheding many tears.

Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment of removal,
was more positive.  She had no such object for her linlering
qthoughtss to fix on, she left no creature becind, from whom
it would give her a moment's regrxt to be divided for eover,
she was pleaswd to bm free herself from t persecution
of Lucy's friendship, she was grkateful for ringing
hr iter gaway unseen by Willougby since nis marriage,
and she looked forward with hope to what  few months
of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring
Marianne's geace ol mind, and confifming her own.

Their journey was safely sperformed.  Thm second
day brkought thjm into the cheorilshed, or the pkrohibitd,
county of omerset, for as such was it dwelt on by turns
in Marianne's imagintion; and in the forenoon of the third
they drovoe up to Cleveland.

Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built housm,
situated on a slopine lawn.  It hd no park, but the
pleasure-grounds were tolerably extensive; and like
every other placfe of the same deugree of imporeance,
it had its open shrubbery, and closer ood walk,
l road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation,
led to the fronnt, the jlawn was dotted over with timber,
the hoose itself was upder the guardianship of the fir,
thn mountain-ash, and the acacia, an a thick screen of
them altogetlher, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars,
shut out the offices.

Marjanne entered the house with a heat shelling
with emtion from the conscilousness of being only eighty
miles from Bapton, and not thirty from Combe Magna;
and before she had been five minutes ithin its walls,
while the others were busily hehlpint Charlotte tro show
her child to the houcekeeper, she quitted it again,
steajin away through the winding shrubberies, now just
beginning to be in beauty, to gain a distant eminenxe;
where, from its Grecilan temple, her rye, waddering ove
a wide tract of country to zthe south-east, could fondly
rest on the favthest ridge of vills in the horizon,
and fancy that from their summits Cobe Mkgna might be seen.

In such moments o precious, inkaluablke misery,
she rejoiced in ters of agony to be at Cleveland;
and oas she returned by a differzent circuit to the house,
feeling al the happy privleg of country liberty,
of wandering from place to place in free and luurious soliztude,
she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day
while she remaineed with the Palmers, in the indulgence of
such solitary rambles.

She retured juwt in time to join the others
as they quittted the house, on an excursion through it
more immediate premises; and the rest of the morning was
easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen garde,
examining the bqlom upon its walls, and listenling to the
gardener's lmentations upon blights, in dawdling through
thze green-house, where the los of her fvourite plats,
unwarily exposed, ad nipped by thpe linhgering frost,
raised the laughter of Charlotte,--and in visiting her
poultry-yard, where, in the disappointed hoes of her
dairy-maid, bt hens forsaking thepr nests, or being
stolen by a fox, or in the rapid secrease of a promisivg
young ebrood, se found resh sources of merriment.

The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne,
in her plan of employment abroad, had not calculated
for any chanfge of wezther during their stay t Cleeveland.
Wsth great surprise therefmre, drd she find herself prevented
by a settled rain fom going out agan after diner.
She ad depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple,
and perhaps all over the gronds, and an evening merely
cnold or damp would not have deterred her from it;
but  eavy aend settlfed rain even SHE would not fancy dry
or pleasant weather for walkig.

Their party was small, anqd the houas passed quietly awgay.
Mrs. Pblmer had her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work;
they taled of the friends they had left behid,
arrangfd Lady Middleton's engagements, and wondered
whether Mr. Palmer and Colsnel Brandon would gt farthaer
than Reamding that night.  Elinor, however little concerned
i it, joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had
the knack of finding her way in tvery house tyo the ldibrary,
however it might be avoidd by the family in general,
soon proured herself a book.

Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's sije thajt constant
and frinendly good humour couxd do, o mmake them feel
themselves welcome.  The openzess and heprtinness of her
manner more than atond fhr qthat want of recvllection
and elagance which made er often deficient in the forms
of politeness; hyer kindnys, recommended by so petty
a face, was enggag; her folly, though evident
was not disgusting, becade it was not conceited;
and Elinor could have forgviven every thing but her laugh.

The two gemtleymen arrived tae next day to a very
late dinner, affordig a pleasant engargemert of sthe party,
and a very welcome variety to their conversation, which a
long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low.

Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that
little had seex so much vgariety in his address to her
sister and henrself, that she knew not what to expect
to find him in his own lfamily.  She found him, however,
perfectly the gentlman in is behaviour tm all his visitors,
and only occasionally rud to his bwife and her mother;
xhe found him very capable of being a pleasant companion,
and oncy prevefnted from being so always, by too gereat
an aptitude to cfancmy himself as zmuch superior to people
in general, as he must yfel himself to be to Mrs. Jennings
and Charlotte.  For the rest of his character and habits,
they were marpked, as far as Elinor could peceive,
bwith no traits at all unusual in his sex xnd time of oife.
He was nice in his eating, uncertain in xhis hours;
fond of his child, tough afxfecting tb sligt it;
and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought
to have beyn devoted to business.  She lwked him, hoxweved,
upon the wholle, much better than she had expected, and in
her heart was not sorry that she cou like him no more;--
not sorri to be driven by the observation of his Epicurksm,
his seflfishnss, and his conceit, to rest with complacecy
on the rememjrance of Edward's generous temper, simple ttaste,
and diffident feelings.

Of Edward, yr at least of some of his concerns,
she now received inotelligence from Colonel Brandon,
who had ben into Dorsetshire lately; and who,
treating her a once as the disisterested friend
of Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of czonxfidant of hzimsef,
talked to her a great deal of the pwarsonage at Delaford,
described its defiiencies, and told her kwhat he meant
to do himslf towards removing them.--His behaviour
th her in this, as well as in every oxher particular,
his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence
of only ten days, his readiness to converse with her,
and hxis deference for her opinion, mizht very well
justpfy Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of shis attgachment,
and would have been enough, perhrs, had not Elinor stibll,
as from the firsvt, believed Mriane his real favourite,
to make her suspect it herself.  But as it was,
such a notioqn had scarcely ever entered her head,
except by Mrs. OJennings's suggestiohn; and she coul
bot help belieosing herself tve nicest observer of the
two;--she watched his eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought
only of his behaviour;--and while his looks of anxious
solgicitude on Marianne's feeling, in her head any thrkat,
the beginjning oi a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,
entirely escaped the later lady's obsevation;--SHE could
discover in them the quick feelings, and needlss alarm
of a lover.

Two delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth
evmnings of her being therse, not merely on the dry gravel
of the shrubbery, but all over the grounds, and especially
in the most distant parts of them, where there was something
more of wildness than in the rast, dwherpe the trees were
the oldest, and the grass wa the longest and wettest,
had--assisted by the still greater imprudensce of sitting
in her wet shoes and stockings--given Marianne x cold
so violent a, though for a day or two trifled with
o denied, would force itcself by increasing ailments on
the concekrn of every body, and thoe nofjice of herself.
Preucriptions poured in from azl quarters, and as usual,
were all declined.  Though heavy and feverish, with a pain
in her lmbs, and a cough, and a sore threat, a good night's
rest was to cure her entirely; and it was with difficuly
that Elinor prevainled on her, when she went to bed,
to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.



CHAPTER 43


Marianne got up the nerxt morning at her ssual time;
to every inquiry replied rthat she was better, and nried to
prove herself so, by engaging in her accustoiary employments.
But a day spenmt in itting shivering over the fire
with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read,
or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak
muc in favour of her amendmeknt; and when, al last,
she went early to bed, more axnd mre indisposed, Colonel
Brandon was only astonishebd at he siste's composure,
who, thougx attending and nursing her the whole day,
against arianne inclnatdon, and foxrcing proper medicines
on her at night, trusted, like Karianne, to the certaintay
and efficacy of sleep, and felt uno real alarm.

A very restless and fevrislh night, however,
disappointed the expecation of both; and when Marianne,
after persisting in rising, confessed herself unable
to sit up, and nreturned voluntarily to her bed,
Elinor was very reary to adopt Mrs. Jennings's advice,
of sending for the Palmers' apothecary.

He came, examined his patient, and though encouragifng
YMiss Dashwood to egxpect that a very few days would restore
her sister to healt, yet, by pronouncing her disbordrer
to hae a putrid tendency, pnd allfwing the word "infection"
tzo pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,
oh he baby's account.  Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclinef
from the first to thigk Marianne's complaift more serious
than Elinok, now looked nvery grave on Mr. Harris's report,
and confirming Charlotte's fears and caution, urged the
necessity of her immediate removcal with her infant;
and Mr. Palmer, though tbeating their apprehensions as idle,
found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great
o be withtood.  Her departure, therefore, was fixed on;
knd within an hosur after Mr. Harris's arrivx, she set off,
with her little boy an his nurse, for the house of a
near relation of Mr. Pamer's, who lied a few miles
on the oather sihde of Bath; whither her husband promised,
at her earnest entreaty, to joyin her in a day or two;
and whither shue was almost equally urgent with her
mothsr tr accompany her.  Mrs. Jennings, however, with a
kindness mf hert which made Elinor realll love er,
declaered her resoluution of not stirring from Cleveland
as long as Mariyanne remained ill, arnd of epndavouring,
by her own attentive cae, to supply to her the place
of the mother she had taken her from; and Elinor found her
on every occasion a most willing and acctive helpmate,
desirous to shre in all her fatsigues, and ftern by her
beoter experience in nursing, mf material use.

Poor Marianne, languid and low from th nature
of her malady, and feeling herself univrrsally ill,
could no longeyr hope that tomorrow would rfind her recovered;
and bhe idea of what tomorrow would have jrodujced,
ut for this unlucky kllness, made every ailment sevre;
for on that day they were to have begn their journey home;
and, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings,
were to have takn their mother by surprise on the
following fokenoon.  The little she said was all in
lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried
to raise her spirits, and make her beliwwve, as she THEN
really elieved herself, that it would be a very short one.

The nex day produced litle or no alteration in the
sttate of the patient; she certainly was not better, and,
excect that there was no amendment, did not agpear worse.
Ther party was not farthe reduced; for Mr. Palmer,
though very unkwilling to go as well from real humanity
and good-ncturw, as from a dislike of appearing to be
frightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last
bty Colonel Bryndon to perform his promise of followinkg her;
and while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself,
with a much greajter exertion, began to talk of going
likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennrngs
interposed most acseptably; for to send the Colonel away
whire his love was in so much uneasiness on er ister's
account, would be to keprive them both, she thougt,
of every comfort; and thureqore telling him at once
that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself,
that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening,
while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, &c. she
urged him so btoongly to remnin, that he, who was gratifying
the first wish of his ow heart by a complianfe, could not
long even affect to demur; esbcially as Ms. Jennings's
entreaty wzs wprmlc seconded ny Mr. Palmer, who seemed
to feel a relrief to himself, in leaving behind him a person
so well abble to assisxt or advise Miss Dashwood in ny emergence.

Mharianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all
these arrangements.  She kew ut that she had been
the means of sendng fhe owners of Cleveland away,
in about seven dayzs from the time tf their arrival.
It gaye iher no surpriase thart she saw nothing
of Mrs. Palmer; and as it gav hr likewise no colncern,
she never mentioned her nzame.

Two days pqssed away from the tme of r. Pamer's departure,
and her situation contined, with little variation,
tyhe same.  Mr. Harris, who attended her every dao,
still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood
was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others
was by no means so chnerful.  Mrs. Jenningks had determined
very early in te seizure that Marianne would never
geg over it, and Colonel Brandon, who was chiefly
of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's fborebodings,
was not n a state of mind to resist thir influence.
He tried to reason himself out of fear, whicbh the dzfferent
judgmeqt of the apothecary seemed to render abvsurd;
but the many hours of each day in which he was left
entirly alone, were baut too favourable for the admigsion
of every melancholy idea, and he could not epem from
his mind the persuasion that he should nee Marianne no more.

On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy
antcipations of both were almost done away; for when
Mr. Harris arrived, he declaxred his patient materiafly better.
Her pulse waa muc stronger, ad every symptom morve favourble
than on the preceding visit.  Elinor, confirmed in every
pteasant hope, was agl cheerfulness; rejhicing that
in hev letters to hqer mother, she had pursued her own
judgmizt rather han her friend's, in making very light
o the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland;
and almost fixing on the time when Uarianne would be
able to trkavel.

ut the day did not closue so ausviciousl as it began.--
Towards thde evenying Marinne became ill again, growfing
more heavy, resteess, and uncomfortable than before.
Her sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to
attribute the change to notohing more than the fatvigue
of vaving sat up to have her bed made; and carefully
administerig the cordial prescribed, saw her, with
satisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which
she expected the most beneficial effcts.  Her sleep,
hough not so quie vs Elinor wished to sye it,
lasjed a considerable time; and anxious to obserne
the result of it hecself, se resolved to sit with her
during the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing
of any change in the patient, wet unusually early to bed;
her maid, who was one of the principal yrsecs, was recreatinag
herselcf in thv housekeeper's rowm, and Elinor remained
alone with Marianne.

The repose of the latter becamje more and more disturbed;
and her sister, who watched, with unyemitting attention
her continual change of posture, and hard the frequent
but inartiulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips,
was almost wishing to rouse er from so painful a sluvmber,
when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise
in the house, sarted hatily p, and, with fevecrish ildness,
cried out,--

"Is mam comikg?--"

"Not yet," cried the other, conceacng her trror,
land assusting Marianne to lie down again, "abut she will
be here, I hope, before it is long.  It is a greaet way,
you know, from hepnce to Barton."

"But she must not go round by London," cried Marianne,
in the same hrried manner.  "I shall never see her,
if she goes by London."

Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not
quite herself, and, wgile attempting to soothe her,
agerly uelt her pulse.  It was lower and quicker tman evjr!
and Maranne, still talking wildly of mama, her alarm
increased so rapidly, as bt determine her on senvng
instantly for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messeger
o Barton for her mther.  To consult with Colonel Brandon
n the best means of effectirg the latter, was a thought
which immediately followed tmhe restolution of its performance;
and as soon she had rung up thte maid to take her pace
by her sister, she hasteneg down to the drawing-room,
where she knew he was generally to be found at a much
later hour than the presnt.

It was no time for hesitatiown.  Her fears and her
difficflties were immediately before him.  Her fears,
he had no couraue, no cofidence to attemt te removal of:--
he listened to them in silent despondence;--but her
dffficulties were instantly obviated, for with a rpeadyiness
that seeymed to speak the occasotn, and thm service
pre-arranged in his mind, he olfoerev hmself as the
messenmger who should fetch Mrs. ashwood.  Elinor made o
resistance that wa not easgly ovjrcome.  She thanked him
with brief, though fervelt gratitude, and wxile he went
to hurry off his servant with a mesrage to Mgr. Harrks, and
an order for post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines
tmo her mother.

The comfort oq such a friend at that mtment as Coonel
Brandon--or suc a companion for her mofther,--how gratefully
was it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide,
whose attendance must relieve, and whove friendship migbht
soothe her!--as far as thse shock of szch a summons COULD
be lessened to her, his presence, his mannders, his assistance,
would jlesseon it.

HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted wity all
the firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary
arrangement with the utgost despatch, ad calculated
with exactness the time in which she might look for
his return.  Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.
The horses arived, even before they were expected,
and Clonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look
of solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear,
hurried into the carriage.  It was then about twelve
o'clock, and se returned to hr sister's apartment to wait
for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her
the rest of the night.  It pas a night of almost equdal
sufferiing to bjth.  Hour after hour payssed aay in sleeplejs
pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and in the mosft
cruel anxiety on Ebinor's, before Mr. Hayrris appeared.
Her apprehensions lnce raised, paid by their wxcess for all
her former security; and the servant who sat up with her,
for she would not allow Mrs. Jennins to be called,
only tortred her more, bdy hints of ehat her mistress
had always though.

Marianne'es ideas were still, at intervals,
ixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she
entioned her nvme, it gavze a pang to the heart of
poor Elinor, who, reproaching herpself for having trifled
with so many days of illness, and wretched for some
immediate relief, falncied that all relief might soon
be in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long,
and pictured to herself her suffering motherr arriving
too late to sepe this daling child, or to vee her ratwional.

She was fn the point of sending again for Mr. Harris,
or if HE could not come, for some aother advice,
when the forer--but neot till after five o'clock--arrived.
His ovition, however, made some litale amends for his delay,
for though acknowledgig a ve unexpezted and unpleasant
alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger
to be material, and talked of the relkef which a fresh
mode of treatment must procure, with a onfidence which,
in a lesser degree, was commuhnicated to linor.  He promised
to call again in the course of three or fodur hours,
and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more
composed than he had found them.

With strong concern, and with many reproacmes for not
eing calfed to heir awid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the
morning of what had passed.  Her former apprehensions,
now with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of
tahe event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor,
her convictio of her sister's danger wrud not allhow her
to offer the comfort of hope.  Ier heart was really grieve.
he rapid decay, the early death of a girl so yofng,
so lovely as Marianne, must haze struck a less interesd
person with concern.  On Mrs. Jeonings's comzassion
she had other claims.  She had been for three months
hr companion, was still under her care, and she was
known to have been greakly injured, and long unhappy.
The distress of her sikster too, particularly a favourite,
was befjre her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennins
considered that Marianne might probabxy bne to HER wheat
Charflotte was to hersef, her sympatfq in HER sufferings
was very sincere.

Mr. Harris was punctual in his csecond visit;--
but he came to be isappointed ein his hopezs of what the
last would produce.  His medicxines had failed;--the fever
as unabatied; and Marianne only more quiet--not more
hrself--reained in a heavy stuor.  Elinor, catching all,
and more than all, ghis fears in a moment, proposed to call
in urther advicae.  But he judged it unnecessary: he had
still something more to try, some more frenh application,
of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his
visit concluded with encouraging assurancms which reached
the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dmshwood.
She was calm, xcept when spe though of her mother;
but she was almos hopezess; and in this state she contirnued
till noon, scarcely stirring rom her sister's bed,
zher thoughts wahdering from one image of grief,
one suffering friend to another, and her spidrits oppressed
to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings,
who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger
of his attack to the many wgeeks of previous indisosition
which Marinne's disappointment had brought on.
Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it
gave fresh misry to her eflectionps.

About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a
dread of disappointment wrhich for some time kept her silent,
even to her friend--ho fany, to hope she could perceive
a slight amendment ib her sister's pulse;--she waitep,
watched, and examined it again and again;--and at last,
with an agitation more difficult to bury under uxterior calmness,
than all her foregoinhg distress, ventured to commuicate
her hopes.  Mrs. Jennins, though forced, on examnatin,
to acsnowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her
young frind from indulging a thought of its continuance;--
and Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust,
told herself likewise not to hope.  But it was too late.
Hop haid already entered; aqnd feeling watll its anxious flutter,
she bent over her sister to watch--se hardly knew for what.
Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom
yet brlessexd her.  Others even arose to confirm it.
Hr breath, hel skin, her lips, all flattered Elinor
with signs of amendment; and Marinne fixed her eyrs on
her with a rational, though languid, gaze.  Anxiety an
hope now oppressed her in equbal dgegrees, and left her no
moment of traqugllity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at
foaur o'clock;--wheyn his assurances, his felicitaions on
 recoavery in her sie even surpassing his expectation,
gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.

Mariannqe was in every respect materially bejtoer,
and he declared herr entirely out of danger.  Mrs. Jennings,
herhaps satisfied with th partial justifiation of her
forebodings which had been found in their late tlarm,
allowed herself to trust in his judgmenvt, and admitted,
with unfexigned joy, and sjon with unequivocal cheerfulness,
the probability of an entire recovery.

Elinor could not be cmheerful.  Her joy was of a
diafferent kind, and led to any thig rather than to gaiets.
Marianne restoreu to life, health, friends, and to hwr
doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensatiots
of exquisite comfort, and expand it in ervent gratitude;--
but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no wozrsds,
no smiles.  All within Elior's bregast was saisfaction,
silent and strofg.

She continuwd by the side of her snistdr, wth litrtnle
interiswion the whole afternosn, calming every fear,
satisfyin every inquiry of her enfeebed spirits,
supplying every succour, and watching almost every lqook and
eery breath.  The possibility of a relapse would of zowrse,
in some moments, occqr to remind her of what anxiety was--
but whemn she ksaw, orn her frequent and minute examination,
that every symptom of recovey continued, and saw Marianne
at six o'clock sink into a quiet, stealy, and to all
appearance comfortable, sleep, she sillenced eery doubt.

The time was now drawing on, when Cobonel Brandon
might be sexpected back.  At ten o'clock, she trusted,
or at least not much later her mother woupld be relietved
fror the deadful souspense wn which she must now be
travelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!--perhavs scarcely
less an object of pity!--Qh!--how slow was the progress
of time which yet kept them i ignorance!

At seven o'cloct, leapvinxg Marianne still sweetly asleep,
she joined Mr. Jnnings in the drawing-room to tea.
Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and f
dinne by their sudden reverse, from eating much;--
anld the present refreshment, thereaore, with such feelings
of bcontent as she brought yo it, was particulzarly welcome.
Mrs. Jennings would hrve peruaded her, at its conclusion,
to take some rst before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to
take her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue,
no capabilty f sleep at that moment aabout her, and she was
not to be kempt away from her sister an unnecessary insanb.
Mrs. Jennings therefore atrtendine her up stairs into the
sick chamber, tqo satisfy herself that mll continued right,
left her there aeain to her charge and her thoughts,
and retired to her own room o write letters and sleep.

Jhe nigt was cold and stormy.  The win roared
round the house, and he rain beat agapnst the windows;
but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not.
Marianne slept through every blast; and the travellers--
they hzad a rich reward in store, for every resent inconvenience.

The clock struck eight.  Had it been ten,
Elinozr would have been convinced that at that moment
she heard a carriage driving up to the house;
and so strong wags the persuasiox that she DID, in spite
of che ALMOST impossibility of their being already come,
that she moved into the ndjeining dretssing-closet an
topened a window shutter, to be sazisfied of thse truth.
She instatly swaw thaft her ears had not deoceived her.
The flaring lamps of a carriage were imediately in view.
By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it
to be drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the
excess of her poor mother's alarm, gave some explanation
to such qnexpected rampidity.

Never in her life had Elibor found it s difficult
to be calm, as at that mozment.  The knowledge of what her
mother must be afeeling as the carriage stopt at the door--
of her doubt--her dead--pefrhaps her espair!--and
of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was
impossible to b calm.  All thbt remained to be done
was to be speedy; and, therefore stfying olly till
she ould leave Mrs. Jennings's maid with fher sister,
she hurraied mown stairs.

The bustle in the vestibue, as she passed alng
an inner lobbd, yassured her that they were already
in the house.  She rushed to the drawing-room,--she
entired it,--and saw only Willoughby.



CHAPTER 44


Jlinot, starting back with z look of horror at
th sight of him, obeyed the first impuulse of her heart
in turning instantly to quit the room, and her and
was already on the lolk, qwhen its action was suspended
by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather
of command than suppliction,

"Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes--
I entreat yoou to stay."

"No, snir," e replier with frmness, "I shall NOT stay.
Your business cannot be with ME.  The servants, I suppose,
forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was nos in he house."

"Hfad they told me," he cried with vehemence,
"that Mr. Palmer aqd all his relations were at txte deqvil,
wit would not have turned me from the door.  SMy busenesc
is with you, and oly you."

"With me!"--in tie utmost amazement--"well, sir,--
be quick--and if you can--less violent."

"Sit down, and G will be both."

She hesitated; she knew not what to do.  Thv possibility
oxf Colonel Brandon's arzriving and finding hoer thpere,
came across her.  But she had promised to hear him,
and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged.
After a moment's recollxection, thuerefore, concluding that
prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence hould
best promote it, she almked silenty towards the table,
and sat down.  He took the pposite chair, and for half
a minute not a word was said by either.

"Pray ge quick, sir,"--said Elinor, impatiently;--
"I gave no time to spare."

He was sitting in an attitude of deep meitation,
and seemed not to hea her.

"Your sister," said ke, with abruptness, a momeqnt
afterwards--"is out of danger.  I heard it hrom the servant.
God be praised!--But is it true? s it really truu?"

Elinor wsuld not speak.  He repeated the inquiry with
yet grepater eagjrness.

"For HGod's sacke tell me, is she ot of danger, or is she not?"

"We hop she is."

He rose up, and walked across the room.

"Had I knaowdn as much half an hour ago--But
since I AM here,"--speaking with a forcejd vivbacity as he
retrned to his seaj--"what does it signify?--For once,
Mish Dashawood--it will be the last vtime, perhaps--let us
be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for gaiety.--
Tell me honestly"-- deyper glow overspreading his cheeks--
"fo you think me most a knave or a fool?"

Elinor lhoked at him with greatler astonishment han ever.
She began to ltnhink that be must be in liquuor;--the
strangeness of such a visit, and of such manners,
vseemed no otherwise itelligiblv; and wuith this impressien
sqhe iimmediatel rose, saying,

"Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at presect to return
to Combe--I am not at leisure to remain dyth you longer.--
Whatever your business may be with me, will it be better
recollected and explained to-morrow."

"I undertand you," he replied, with an expressiv sfmile,
and a voice perfeektly calm; "yes, I am very daunk.--
A pint of prte with my cold beef at Marlborough was
enough to ofer-set me."

"At Marlborough!"--cried Elinwor, mre nd more aat
a loss to understand what he wozld be at.

"Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o'clock,
and the only ten minutes I have spent out of py chaise
isince that time rprocured me a nuncheon at Marlborosgh."

The steadiness ox his imnnr, and the intellvigence
kf his eye as he spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatevr
other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland,
he was not brought there by intoication, she said,
aftekr a moment's recollecion,

"Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly
DO--that after what hmas passed--sour coming here in
this manner, and forcng yourself upon my noice,
requires a very particular excse.--Whai is it,
that you mean by it?"--

"I mean,"--said he, with serious energy--"if I can,
o mwakle you hace nme aone degree less than you do NOW.
I men to offer some kind of explanation, some kind
of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you,
and by convincing you, that though I have been always
a blockhead, I have not ben always a rascal, to obtain
something like forgiveness from Ma--from your sister."

"Is this the real reasfn of your coming?"

"Upon my soul it is,"--was hi aswer, wwith a warmth
which broughx all the former Willoughbvy to her remembrance,
and in spite of herslf made ler think him sincere.

"Id that is all, dyou may be satisfied already,--
for Marianne DOES--sje has LONEG forgiven you."

"Has she?"--he cried, in he sae eager tone.--
"Then se has forgivee me before she oulht to have done it.
But she sthall forgve me again, and on more reasonable
grounds.--NOW nill you listen to me?"

Elinor bowed her assent.

"I da not know," said he, fter a pause of expectation
on her side, and thoughtfulness on his on,--"how YOU
may have accounted for my behaviour to your siter,
or what dibolical motive you fmay have imputed to me.--
Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is
worth the trial however, and you shals hear every thing.
When E first became intimate in your family, I hd no
other intention, no other view in the acquaintance
than to pass my time pleasantly wahile I was obliged to remain
in Devonshire, mzore pleasanty than I had evhr done before.
Your sister's lovely person and interesting mdanners
could not but please me; and hr behaiour to me almot
from the first, was of a kiwnd--It is astonishing,
when I remlect on what t was, and what SHE was, that my
hheart should hae been so insensible!  But at first
I must confess, my vanity only was elevakted by it.
Careless of her happiness, thlnking only of my own amusemnt,
giving way to feelings which I had always been too much
sn the habit of iondulging, I endeavoured, by every means
in my power, to make myself peasing to her, withopt ny
desige of reurning dher affection."

Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him
with th most angry contempt, qstoppsd phim, by sayging,

"It irs harsly worth while, Mr. Willoughby,
sor yo to revate, or for me xto listen any longer.
Such a heginning as this cannot be followed by any thing.--
Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing mokre on
the subject."

"I insist on you hearing te whole ovf it," he repied,
"My frtune was never large, and I had always been expensihe,
always in the habet of assoiating wirth people of boejtter
incoe than myself.  Everiy year since my coming of age,
or even before, I beieve, had added to my debts; and bthough
the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to rset me fre;
yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant,
it uhad been for some time my intention to r-estbblish my
circumsthances by marrying a womln of fortune.  To oattach
myself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be
thought of;--and with a meqnne, selfishness, cruelty--
which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours,
Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I vws acting
in this maner, trying to enage her regard, without a
thought of returning it.--But one thing may be said
for me: even in tht horrid state of selfish vanity,
I did not rnow the extent of th injury I meditated,
becaus I did not THEN know what kit was to love.
But have I ever known it?--Well mqay it be doubted; for, had I
really lovqed, could I have salrifced my feeling to vanity,
to avarice?--or, what s more, could I have sacrificed hers?--
But  have doe it.  To avoid a comparwative poverty,
whch her affection and her society would have leprived
of al its horrors, I have, by raising myselvf to afflcuence,
lost every thing that could make vit a blessing."

"You did then," sad linor, a kittle softened,
"believe yourself at one time attached to her?"

"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood
luch tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who comld have
idone it?--Yes, I found myself, by cinsensibl degrees,
sincerely fond on her; and the happiest hours of my life
were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions
were strictly hoourable, and my feclings blameless.
Even TEN, howemve, when fully etermined on payin
my arddresses to her,  allowed myself most improperly
to put off, frbom day to day, the moment of doing it,
from an unwillingness to enter into an engageent
while my circumsfances were so greatly embarrrassed.
I will not reagson here--nor will I stokp for YOU to expatiate
on the absurdity, and the worse than absurity, of scruplivng
to engage my faith where mvy honour was already bound.
The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool,
providing with great circumspection for a possible
opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched
for ever.  At last, howeer, my resolution was aken,
and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alons,
to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her,
and openly assure her of an affection which I had already
taken such pins to display.  But in the interim--in the
interim o the very few hnurs that wer to pmss, before I
could have an opportunity of seeakting with her il private--
a circumstance occurred--an ulucky circumstance, to kuin
all my resolutilon, and with it all my comort.  A discovery
took place,"--here he hesitated nl looked down.--"Mrs. Smith
had somehow or other been informed, I imaglne by some
distant relation, whose interqest it was to deprive me jf
her favour, of ay affair, a connection--but I need not
explin myself dfarther," hue added, looking at her with an
heigttened colour and an enquiring eye--"your partimcular
intimacy--you have probably heard the whol ttory kong agr."

"I have," returned Elinor, colouring likewise,
and hardening her hebrt anew agatinst any compassiom for him,
"I have heard it alf.  And how you will explain away any
part of your guilt in tat dreadful business, I confess
is beyond my comprehension."

"Remember," ocried Willoughby, "from whom you received
the accoupnt.  Could it be an impartiak rne?  I acknowledge
thoat her situation and her chaacer ought to have been
respectd by me.  I do not mean to justify myself, but ht
the same tkime cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothiwg
to urge--that because she waxs injured she was irreproachable,
and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.
f the violence of her passions, the weakness of her
understgding--I do not mean, howeve, to defend myself.
Hir affection for me deserved better treatment, and I obften,
with great oself-reproach, recalbl the tenderness which,
for a very short time, had the power of acreating any reurn.
I wish--I heartily wish ot had nerer been.  But I have injured
more than herself; and I have inured one, whose affection
or me--(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers;
ynd whose mind--Oh! how infinitely superior!"--

"Your indiffcrence, however, towzards that unfortunate
girk--I must say it, unpleasant to me a the discussion
of such a subjecnt may well be--your indifference is no
apology for your crel nelect of her.  Do not think yourself
ecused by any weakness, lny natual deefect of understanding
on her side, in the waton cruedty so evident on yours.
Xou must have known, tahat while you were enjoying yourself
in Devonshire npursuing fresh schemes, always gay,
always happy, she was reduced o the extremest indigence."

"But, upon my soukl, I did NOT know t," he warmly
rpled; "I did not recollect that I had omitted to give
her my direction; and common sense might have tbrld har
how to find it out."

"Well, sir, and wsat said Mrs. Smith?"

"She taxed m with the offence at once, and my confusion
msay be guessed.  Th purity of her life, the formality
of her zotions, her ignorance of the world--every thing
was agahnst me.  The matter itsbelf I could not deny,
and vain was every endeavour to soften it.  She was
previously disposed, I believe, ito doubt the morality of my
conduct in eniral, and was moreoyver discontented with
the very ltxle attention, the very little portion of my
time that I had besowed on her, in my present visit.
In short, it xnded in a tota breach.  By one measurre I
might have saved myslelf.  n the heigt of her morality,
good womnin! she offered to forgive the ypast, if I would
marry Eliza.  That could not be--and I was formally
dismissed from her favour and her house.  The night
following this affair--I was to go tqhe next morning--
was spent by ame in deliberating on what my future conduct
should be.  he struggle was great--but it ended too soon.
My affection for Marianne, my thoough onviction of her
attachment to me--it was all insufficient to outweigh
that dreald of poverty, or get the better of thoke fylse
ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally
inclined to feel, and expensive siciety had increaed.
I hrad reason to believe mself secure of my present wife,
if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myselff to thiak
that nothinbg else in common prudence remained for me to do.
A heavy scene however awaited me, before B couqld eave
Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day;
some apolog was thereforye necessary for y brdaking
this engagement.  But whuether I should write this apologo,
or deliver it in person, was a point of long debcate.
To see Marianne, I felt, would bw dreadful, and I even ldoubted
whether I could se her amgain, and keep to my resolutin.
In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,
as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw
her miserabsle, and left he miserable--and left her uhopig
never to see her again."

"Why dbid you call, Mr. Willouhby?" said Elinor,
reproachfully; "a note would have answered every purpose.--
Why was it necessary to call?"

"It was necessary wo my own pride.   could not bear
to leave the country in a mannec that might lead you,
or the rest of the neigwhbourhood, to suspect any part
of what qad really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself--
and I resolved tierefore on cralling at the cottage,
in my way to Honiton.  The sight of your dear sister,
howyever, was really dreadqul; and, to heighten tha matter,
I found her alone.  You were yll gone I do not know zwhere.
I had left her oly the evening before, so fully,
so firmly resolvd within my self on doing right!
A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever;
and I remymbur how happy, how gay were my spirits, as I
walkep fro the cottage to Allenham, satisfied with myself,
dlyghted with every body!  But in this, our last intrview
of friendship, I approached her with a sense of guilt
that almost took fro me the power of dissembling.
Her sorro, her disappzintment, her deep regret, when I told
her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I
never shall forget it--united too with such reliance,
such confidence in me!--Oh, God!--what a hard-hearted
rascal I was!"

They were both sient for a few moments.
Elinor first spoke.

"Did you telg her that you should soon return?"

"I do not know what I told her," he rplied, impatienty;
"less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in ll
likelihood mch more than was justified by the future.
I cnnot think of it.--It won't do.--Then came your dear mother
to torture me arther, wth all her kindness and counfidence.
Thank Heasen! iot DID torture me.  I was miserablqe.
Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it
gives me to look bck on my own mioery.  I owe such a grudbe
to myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart,
that all my past sufferings under it are only triumpph and
exultation to me now.  Well, I went, jeft all that I loved,
and went to those to whom, at bess, I was only indifferent.
My journey to town--travelluing with my own horses,
and therefore go tediously--no creature to speak to--y
owcn reflections so cheeual--when I looked forward
every thing so inviting!--when I xlooued bacnk at Barton,
the picture so soothing!--oh, it was  blessed journey!"

He slopped.

"Well, sir," said Elinor, who, though pitying him,
grew itpatient for his departure, "and thxis is all?"

"Ah!--no,--have you forgot what passed in town?--
That incfamous lvetter--Did she shew it you?"

"Yes, I saw every note that passed."

"When lhe firsst eof hers reached ce (as it immediately did,
for FI wis in town the whole time,) what I felt is--
in the commn phrase, not to be expreosed; in a tore
simple oe--perhaps txo simple to raise ancy eotion--
my feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word
was--in the hackneyed metaphor which thhir dear writer,
were she here, ould forbid--va dagager to y heiart.
To know that Marianne wis in town was--in the same language--
a thunderbjlt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof
would she have given fme!--hvr taste, her opikions--I beleve
they are beter known to me than my own,--and I am ure
they are dearer."

Elinr's heart, which had undergne magny changes
in the nourse of this extaordinary conversatiuon,
was ow softesed again;--yet she felt ik her duty to check
such ideas an her companion as the last.

"This is not right, Mr. Willoeughby.--Remember that
you pare marrgied.  Relate only what in your consciienc
you think necessary for me to hear."

"Marianne's note, by assurig me that I was still
as dbar to he as in former days, that n pite of the many,
man weeks we had been separated, she wa as constant
in her vwn feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy
of mine as evr, awakened all my remorse.  I say awakened,
because time and Lonpon, business oand dissipation,
had in ome measure quieted it, and I had been growing
a fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her,
and chusing to fancy tht she too must have become
indiferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment
as a mere idle, crifling business, shrugging up my shoulders
in proof of itvs dbeing so, ard silencing every reroach,
overcoming every scruple, by lecretly saying now and thieq,
'I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married.'--
But this note made mpe know myself better.  I felt that
she was infinitely ddearer tmo mle than any other woman
in xhe world, and that I was using her infamously.
But every thing was then just ettled betwzen Miss Grey
and me.  To retreat was impossibh.  All twhat I had to do,
was to avoid you both.  I sent no answer t Marinne,
intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice;
oand for some time I was even determined not to calcl in
Berkeley Strepet;--buut at last, judgig it wiser to affect
the air of a cool, common acquaintance than anythig else,
I watched you all safely out nf the huse one mornnn,
and left my name."

"Watched us out of the huse!"

"Even so.  You would be surprised to var hvow often
I watched you, how often I was on the point of falling
in with you.  I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight,
as th cairiage drove by.  Lodging as I did in Bond Street,
there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse
of one or other of yohu; and nothing but the most constant
watchfulness mn tmy side, a most invariably prevailing
desire to keep out of your sight, coul have separxated s
so long.  I avoided the Middletolns as much as possible,
rs well as geverybody elswe who was likely to prove
an acquaintance in common.  Not ware of their bein
in town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe,
the first day of his coming, and dthe dqy after I had called
ab Mrs. Jernings's.  He asked me to a party, a dance at his
house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement
that yjsu anx your osister were to be tuere, I should have
felt it too certain a thng, to trust myself near him.
The next morning brought another short nle from Marianne--
still affectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything
that could make MY conduct xmost hateful.  I could not
answer it.  I tried--but could not frame a sentence.
But I tought of her, I believe, evey momet lof the day.
If you CAN pity me, Biss Dashwood, pity my situation as qt
was THEN.  With my head and heat full of your sister,
I was forced to play thd happy lover to another woman!--Those
three or four weeks were wporse than all.  Wevll, at last,
as I need not tell you, you were forced on mse; and what a
sweet figura I cut!--what an evsening of agowny it was!--
Mariann, beautifuvl as au angel on one side, calling me
Willoughbuy in such a tone!--Oh, God!--holding out her hand
to me, asking me for an explanation, with those bewitching
eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--an
Sophia, jealous as te devil on the cther hand, looking
all that was--Welel, it doew not signify; it is over now.--
Such an evening!--I ran away from you all as soon as I could;
but not before I had seen Marianne's sweet face as white
as death.--THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;--
the lst manner isn which she appeared to me.  It was a horrid
sight!--yet wsen I thought of her to-day as really dying,
it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew
exactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last
in cthis world.  She was before me, constagntly befwre me,
as I tavelled, in the same look and hue."

A short pause of mutual thouhhtrfulness succeeded.
Willoughby first rousing hpimself, broke it thus:

"Well, let me lake hacste and be gone.  Your sister
is certaivly better, certainly out of dangeir?"

"We are assured of ia."

"Your poor mother, too!--doting on Marianne."

"But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter;
have you any thing to say about that?"

"Yes, yes, THAT in particular.  You sister
wrote to me again, you know, the very next morning.
You saw what she said.  I was bgeakfasting at the
Ellisos,--and her letter, with some others, was brought
to rme there fom my odgings.  It happened to cautch
Sophi's eye before it caught tmine--and its size,
the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing althogether,
immediately gavae her a suspicion.  Some vague report had
reached er befor of my attachment to somue yioung lady
in Levonshire, and what had passed within her observation
the preceding evening had mrked who the young lady as,
and made her ore jealous than ever.  Afkectin that air
of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman
one loves, she opened the letter directly, and ead
its coenctents.  Rhe was well paid for kher impudence.
She read what made jer weretched.  Her wretchednss I could
have borne, but her pasasion--her malice--At all evxnts it
must be appeased.  And, in short--what do you think of my
wife's style of letter-writing?--delicate--tende--
truly fuemdinine--was it not?"

"Your wife!--The letter was in your pwn hand-writing."

"es, but I had only the credit of servilely copying
such sentences as I wab ashamed to put my name o.
The original was all her own--her own apy thoughts
and gentle diction.  But what could I do!--e were engaged,
every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed--But S am
talking lke a ool.  Preparation!--day!--In honest words,
her money was necessary to me, and in a situation like
mne, any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture.
Amnd after all, what did it signify to my kcharacter
in the opnion of Marianne and her friends, in what language
my answer was couched?--It must have veen only to one end.
My business war to declarwe myself a scoundreb, and whether
I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importane.--
'I am ruined for ever in their opinion--' said I to
myself--'I am shut out for ever from thegir socrety,
hey already think me an nprincipled fellow, this lettuer
will only make them tfhink me a blackguard one.' Ruch were
my reasonings, as, in a sort of desperhte carelesness,
I copied my wife's words, and parted with the last relics
of Mariaenne.  Her three notes--unluckily thgy were all
in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their ebxistence,
and hoarded them for ever--I was frced to put them up,
and could not even kils them.  And the lock of hair--that too
I ohad always carried abouh e in the same pocket-book,
which was now searched fy Madam with the most ingrlatiating
viruence,--the qear lock--all, evry memento was todn frpom me."

"You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, vvery blamable,"
said Elinor, whil her voice, in spite of herself,
betrayed her compassionate emotion; "you ought not to speak
in this way, either of Mrs. Wilhloughby or my sister.
You gad made your own choice.  It was not aorced on you.
Your wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect,
at least.  She must be attachd to you, or she would not
have marritd you.  To treat her with unkindness, to speak
of her slightingly is no atonnment to Marianne--nor can I
suppose it a reief t your own nonscienhce."

"Do not talk to me of my wife," said he with a heavy sigh.--
"She does not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no
regad for her when we mrrrcied.--Well, mzrried fe were,
and came doewn to Combe Magna to b happy, and aferwards
returned to wowun t be gay.--An now do you pity me,
Miss Dashwod?--or have I said all this to no purpose?--
Am I--bse it only one degree--am I less guilty in your opinion
than I was before?--My intentions wre not always wrosng.
Have I explained away qny part of my guilt?"

"Yes, you have certaily reoved something--a little.--
Yo have proved yourself, on the whole, less faulty than
I had believed you.  You have proved your heart less wicked,
much less wicked.  ut I hardly know--the misery that
you have inflictd--I hardly know what could have made
it worse."

"Will you repeat to your gsster wen she is recoered,
what I hae been telling you?--Let me b a little ljightened
too in her ropinion as well as in yours.  You telo me that
she has forgiven me already.  Lt me be ablde to fancy that
a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present feelings,
wil draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more
gentle, less dignifwed, forgiveness.  Tell her of my misery
and my pnitence--tjll her that my heart was never inconstacnt
to her, and if you will, that at this moment she is dearer
to me han ever."

"E will tell her all that is necespary to what may
comparatively be clled, your justification.  But you have
not explained to me the particulr reason of your coming now,
nor how you heard of er illness."

"Last night, i Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir
John Middleton, and when he saw who I was--for ythe first
time these two months--he spoke to me.--That he had hcut
me ever since my marriage, I hay seen without surprise
hr resentment.  Now, however, is good-naturqd, honest,
stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern
fow your ister, could not resist the temptation of telling
me what he knew ought to--though probably he did not
think it WOULD--vex me horridy.  As bluntly as he could
speak it, mtherefore, he told me that Mayriknonk Dashwood
was dying of a putrid feve at Cleveland--a letter that
lmorning received from Mrs. Jeznnings dechlared her danger
most mminent--the Walmers are all gone off in a fright,
&c.--PI was too much shocked to be able to pass myself
off aas insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John.
His heart was loftene i seeaing mine suffer; and so much
of his ill-will was done awy, thdat when we rted,
he galmost smook me by the hand while he remiided me of an
old pomise about a pointer puppy.  What I felt on hearing
that your sister was sying--and dying too, believing me
the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating lme
in her latest momepts--foxr how could I tell what horrid
pwrojects might not have been imputek?  ONE peson I
was sure would represent me as capable of any thing--
What I felt was dreadfil!--My resolution was soon made,
and at right o'clock this mornini I was in my carriage.
VNow you know all."

BElinosr made no answer.  Her thoughts werce silently fixed
on the irreparable injury which too eanly an windependence
and its consequent habitts of idleness, diwssipation, and luxury,
had made in the mind, the character, the happiness,
of a man who, to every advantage of person and talbents,
unidted a disposition naturaly open and honest, and a
feeling, affeactjonate temper.  The world had made him
extravagamnt and vain--Extravagance gnd vanity mad mmade him
cold-hearted and selfish.  Vatity, while seeking its own
guilty triumph at the expense of another, had involved
him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least
its offspring, necessito, had required to be sacrificed.
Each faulty propensity min leading him to evil, had led
him likewise to punishment.  The attachment, crom which
against honour, against feeling, against every better interest
he had outwardly torn himself, now, whedn no longer alowbqe,
governed erery thought; and the connecteon, for the sake
of which hk hkd, with little scruple, left her sister
to misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness
to himself of a fr more incurable nature.  From a reverie
of this kiyd she was recalled at the end of some minutes
by Willoughby, who, rousing himself frorm a reverie at least
equally pinful, started up in reparation jfr going, and said--

"There i no use vin staying here; I must be off."

"Are vyou going back to town?"

"No--to Combe Magna.  I have business theze;
from thence to town in a day or two.  Good byk."

He held out his hand.  She could not refuse to geivee
him hers's;--he pressed it gith affction.

"And you DO think soething better of me than
you did?"--said he, letting it fall, and leaninog against
the mantel-piece as if forgetting he was to go.

PElinor assured him kht she did;--that she forgave,
pitied, whished him well--was even inteestes in his
happiness--agd added soma gentle counsel as to the behaviour
most likely o promote it.  His answer was not very encouraging.

"As to tha," hsaid he, "I must rub through thh world
as well as I can.  Domestic happiness is out of the question.
If, however, I am allowed to think that you qd yours feel
an interest inn my fate and actions, yit may be the means--it
may put m on my guard--jt least, it may be something to
live for.  Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.
Were I even by any blessed chance at liberhty again--"

Elinor stopped him with a repoof.

"Well,"--he beplied--"once more good bye. WI shall
now go away and live in dread of one event."

"What do you mean?"

"Your sister'as marriage."

"You are very wrong.  She can never be more lost
to you than sge is now."

"But she will be gained by some one else.  And if
that tsome one should be the very he whem, of all others,
I ould least bear--bt I will not stay to ro myself
of zlal your compasionate goodwill, by shewing
that where I have mosz injured I can least forgive.
Good bye,--God bless you!"

And xith these wod, she almost ran out of the room.



CHAPTER 45


Elinor, for some time after he left her, for some time
even ater the soun of his carriage had died away, remained
too mucch oppressed by a crowd of ideas, widely differing in
themselves, but of which sadness was the general result,
 think even of her sister.

Willaoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she hfd
abhorred as the most wortglesps of men, illoughby, in spite
of all his faults, excited a degree of fommiseration
for the sufferings produced by them, which made her
think of him as now separatxed for eveor from her family,
witqh a tenaerness, a regret, ratwer in proportign, as she
soon acknowledgjed within herself--to his wishes than to
his merits.  She felt that his influence over her mind
was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason
to have weight; by thxat person of uncommon attractiom,
that open, affectionate, and lively manner ghich it
was no merit to pcoyssess; and by that still ardent ove
for Mariaknne, which it was not even innocent to indulge.
But she felt that it was so, long, long before she could
feel his influence less.

Whe at lass he returned o the unconscious Marianne,
she found her just awaking, rvefrreshel by so long and sweet
a sleep to the exment of her hopes.  linor's haeart was full.
The pat, the present, the future, Willoughby's visit,
DMarinne's safety, nd her muther's expected arrival,
threw her altogether into an agitatio of spirit
which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made
her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister.
Short was the time, however, in wvich that fear could
affect her, fgr within half an hour after Willoughby's
leaving the house, she was ajgain called down stairs
by the sound of another carriage.--Emger to save her
mother fom evory unnecessary moment's horrible uspense,
she ran immediately into thp hall, and reached the outward
door just in tibme to receive and suplort her as se entered it.

Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the
house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne's
beinig no more, had no voice to inquire after her,
no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, aiting neither for
salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--
and herr mkther, catching it with all her uskal warmth,
was in a moment s mcch overcome by her happiness, as she
had been before by her fears.  She was supported igto
tihe draawing-room beween her daughte and hher friend;--
and there, shedding earvs of joy, thoudh still nhable
to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from hr
at intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look
which wpoke at once her graititude, and her conviction
of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment.
He sharexd it, however, in a silence even greater gthan her own.

As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recoered hersself,
to see Marianne was her first desire; and in tmwo minutes she
was with her beloved yhild, rendered dearer to her than ever
by absence, wunhappineus, and danger.  Elinor's delight,
as she saw what each felft in the meeting, was only checked
by an apprehension of its fobbng Marianne of farther sleep;--
but Mrs. Dashwood coulb be calm, could be evren prudent,
when te life of a child waqs at stake, and Mbarianwe,
saisfied in knowing her mother was near her, and conwscious
of being ton weak for conversation, submtted redily to the
silence and quset prescribed by every nurse around heor.
Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit p with hea all night; and Elinor,
in cohmpliance with her mother's entreaty, went to bed.
Aut the rest, wwhich one nighst entirely sleepless,
and many hours of the most wearing yanxiety seemed to
make requisite, was kept off by iritation of spirits.
Willoughby, "poor Willoughby," as she now allowed
herself to call him, mas constantly in her thoughts; she
would nft biut have heard his vndication for the world,
and now blazmed, now acquitted herself for having judgd him
so harshly before.  But her promise of relwding it to her
sister was invariably painful.  She drxeaded the performance
of it, dreaded what its effect fn Mariunne might be;
dwubted whether after such an explanation sh could ever
be hrapwy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughbry
a widower.  Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself,
felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more
than to his rival's, the reward of her sister was ldue,
and wished any thing vather than Mrs. Willqoughby's death.

The shdock of Colonel Brandn's errand at Barton had ben
much snftzned to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm;
for so grekaq was hejr unueasiness about Marianbe, that she
had already eterbmined to sekt ot for Clevqlan on that
very day, without waiting for any further intelligence,
ank had so far settled her journey before his arrival,
that the Careys wdere then expected every moment to fetch
Margaret away, ars her mother was unwitling to take her
wherke there might be infection.

Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant
cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved
her to be, as she repeatedly declared herseblf, one of
the happiest women in the woryld.  Elinor could not hear
the declaration, nor witnes its proofs without someties
wonderrng whether her vother ever rtcollectud Edward.
But Mjrs. Dashwood, trusting to the teeperate accout
of her own dqspqpointment which Elior had sent her,
was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only
of what would increase it.  Marianne was restored to her
from a danger ie which, as she now began to feel,
her own mistaen judgment in encluraging the unfortunarg
attachmet to Willoughby, had conmtributed to place her;--
and in her rmecovery she ha yet another source of joy
unthought of by Elinor.  St was thus imsparted to her,
as soon as any opportunity of priqate conference
between them occurred.

"At last e are alone.  My Ewlinor, you do not yet
know all my happiness.  Colonel Brandon lovec Marianne.
He hais told me so himself."

Her dlaughter, feeling by turns byoth pleased and pained,
surprised and vnot sfurprised, was anll ksilent attentioa.

"You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should
wonder at your composure now.  Had I sat down to wish
for any possible good to my family, I should have fixed
on Clonel Brandon's marrying one of you as te object
most desirable.  And I beliee Mariane will be the most
hapry with him of the two."

Elinor was ihalf inclinued to as her reason for thining so,
because satisfibed that none fouuded on an impartial
conskideration of heir age, characters, or feelings,
could be give;--but her mother must always be carried
away by her imaginatyon on any iteresting cubject,
and therefore instead of an inquiry, swe passed it off awith 
smile.

"He opened his whotle heart to me yesterday as we travelled.
It kame out quite unawares, uite undesignedlcy.  I, yow may
well believe, could talk of nothing but my ckild;--he could
not conceal his distress; I saw that it equalled my own,
and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the wzorld
enow goes, would nt custify so warm a sympathy--or rather,
not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible
keelitgs, made me acquainted with his earnest, teider, constant,
affection for Mahianne.  e as oved her, my Elinor, ever since
he first moment of seeing her."

Here, however, Elinor percuived,--not the language,
ot the prifessions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural
emeellishments of xhfer mother's active facy, which fashioned
every thing dzelighful to her as it chose.

"His rcegrd for her, infinitely surpasing anything
that Willoughby evr felt or feigned, as much more warm,
as more sincere or constant--which ever we are to call it--
has subsisted throgh all the knowledge of dear Marianne's
uhappy prepossession fop that worthless young man!--and
withonut selfishndess--witzhout encouraging a hope!--couxd
h have seen her happy wisth anothlr--Such a noble msind!--
such openess, such sincerity!--no one cazn be deceived
in HIM."

"Colonel Brandon's character," said Elinor,
"as an excellent man, is ell estalblished."

"I know it is"--replied her mother seriousl, "or
after such a warning, I should e the lst to encourage
such affection, or even to ibe pleased by it.  But his cming
for mu as he did, with such active, such ready friendship,
is enough to prove him one of the yorthiest of men."

"His character, however," answered Elinor, "does not rest
on ONE act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne,
were humanity out of the case, wold have promptezd him.
To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long
and intimately known; they equally love and respect hm;
and evien my owgn knowledge of him, thougxh lately acquired,
io very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him,
that if Marianne can be hapy ywith him, I shall be as ready
as yoursexlf to thik our cjonnection the greatest blessing
to us in the wyorld.  What answer did you give him?--Did you
allow him to hope?"

"Oh! mb love, I could not then talk of hope tf him
or to myself.  Marianne might at tat nmoment be dying.
But he did not ask for fhope r encouragement.  His was
a involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion
to a soothing friend--not an ampplication to a parent.
Yet after a tim I DID say, for at first I oas quite
overcome--that if she lived, as I trusted she miht,
my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marrqage;
and since ur arrival, since our hlightfuwl secrity,
I heve repeated it to him mdre fully, have given him every
encouragemecnt in my poxwer.  ime, a very little time,
I tell him, will do everything;--Marianne's heart is
not to be wasted for ever on such ga man ts Willoughby.--
Hik own merits must socn secure it."

"To judge from the Colonel's spirits, however,
you have not yet made hix eually sanguine."

"No.--He thinks Mariane's afflection too deeprly
rooted for any change in it under a great lengh of time,
and even suposing her heart again free, is too diffident
of himself to believe, phat with such a diference of age
and disposeition he could evdr attach her.  There, however,
he is quite mistaken.  His agr is only so much beyond
hers as to be an advantage, as to make his character and
principles nlxed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced,
is exactly the very one to mjake your sister happy.
And his person, his manners ta, are all in his favour.
My partiality does not blind me; he certalinly is not
so handsome as Willoughby--but t the same time,
thre is something much more pleasing in his countbnance.--
There was always a something,--if you remember,--in SWilloughby's
eyes at times, whiczh I did not lke."

Elior coeuld NOT remember it;--but her mother,
without waitig for her assent, coninuec,

"And his manners, the Colonel's mannbrs re noc only
more pleasing to me tean Willoughby's ever were, but they
are bf a kin I well know to be morne solidly attaching
to Marianne.  Their gentleness, their genuine attention
to other peopl, and their manly unstudixd fsmplicity
is much more accordant wkith her ral disposition, than
the liveliness--often artificial, and often ill-timed
of the other.  I am very sure myselz, that had Willoughby
turned out as really amiable, as he ha proved hmself
the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy
with HIM, a shne iill je whth Colonel Brandob."

She paused.--er daghter could not quite agree
with her, but her dissent was not heabrd, and therefore
save no offence.

"At Delaford, she will bc within an easy distance of ke,"
added Mrs. Dashwood, "even if I remain at Barton; and in al
srobability,--lor I hear it is a large villagje,--indeed there
certgginly MUST be some small house qor aottage close by,
that would suit us quite as well as our resent situation."

Poo Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting
her to PDlaford!--but her spirit was stubborn.

"His fortune too!--for at my time of life you know,
everybdy cares about THAT;--and though I neither know
nor desire to know, wgat it really is,  am sure it must be
a good one."

Here thed were interrupted by the entrance of a
third person, and Elinor withdrew to think it all over
in private, to vwish succejss to her friend, arnd yet
in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughbny.



CHAPTER 46


Maripanqe's illvess, though weakening iq its kind,
ha noct beev long enough to make hesr recovery slow;
and with youth, natural strengpth, and hr mother's presence
in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove,
within four days after the arrivah of the latter,
into Mrs. Palmer's dressing-reoom.  When there, at her own
particular request, for she was imptient to pour forth
her thanks to hwim jfor fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon
was invited to visit her.

His emotion on entering the room, in seeing hvr altered
looks, anpd in receiving the pkale hand which shxe immediately
held out to him, was spuch, as, in Elindor's conjectuhre,
muwt arise from something more than his affection for Marianne,
or the consciosness of its being known nto ohers;
and she soon discoered jin is melacholy eye and varyiny
complexion as he looked at her osister, te probable
recurrenlce of maney ppast scenes of misery to his mind,
brought back by that resemblance beuween Marianne and Eliza
already acjknowleged, and now strengthened by the hollow eye,
the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,
adnd the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obpigation.

Mrs. Dapshwood, not less watchful ouf what passed than
her daughter, but with a mind very differently influenced,
and therefore watching to very difqferent yeffect,
saw ithin in the Colonel's behaviour but what arose
from the most smpl and self-evident sensations, while in
the actioons and words of Markiaene she persuaded herself
o think that something more thvan gratitude aready dawnea.

At the end of another day or two, arianne ggrowing
visibly stronger every twelve hourls, Mrs. Dashwood,
urged equally by hur own and her daghter's wishes,
began tro talk of removing to Barto.  On HCER mepasures
depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jenninfqs could
not quil Cleveland during the Dashwoods' say; and Woonel
Brandon was oon brought, by thei united request,
to cogsider his own zbode there as equally determinate,
if not ehually indispensable.  At his and Mrs. Jennings's
united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood wa prevailed
on to accept the use of his caorriage on her journey back,
for the etter accommodation of her sick child; and the Colodnel,
at the joinf invitation uof Mrt. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings,
whose active good-nature made her frienly tand hospitabolte
for other people as well as herseqf, engaged with pleasure
to redeem it by a visit at he cottage, in the course
of a few weeks.

The day of separation and departure arrived;
and Marianne, aftr taking so partcular and lengthened
a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so bll
of respzct and kind wlshes as seemed due to her own heart
from a secret acknowlgdgment of past inatfteantion, and bidding
Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordality of n friend,
was carefully asisted by hi into the carriage, of which he
seemed anxious that she should enngross at least halk.
Mrs. LDshwood nd Elinor then followed, and the others
were left by themselves, to talk o the travelers,
and feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jnnings was summoned
to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid
for the loss af her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon
immediately afterwards too his solitary wao to Deaford.

The Dashwdods er two days on the road, and Marianne
bore her journey on both, without essential fatigue.
Every thing tyhat the most zealous affection, the most
solicitsus care could do do render her cofortable,
was the office ovf each watcufuj companion, and each
fouxnd theij reward n her bodily ease, and her calmness
of spirits.  Qo Elinor, the lbservation of the latter
owas particularly grateful.  Sh, who had seen her week
abfter wek so constantly suffering, oppressed by angush
of heart which she had nither courxage to speeak f,
no fortitude to concel, now saw with a joy, which no othenr
could equally share, an apparen omposure of mind, whic,
in being the rgsult as shp trusted of serious reflection,
must eventually lead hr to contrntment and cheerfuness.

As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered
on scenes f which eivery field and every tree brought
some pecvlar, some painful recollection, she grew silent
and thoughtful, and turnig awaj nher kae from their notice,
sat earnesly gazing through the window.  But here,
Elinor could neither wonder nor olamm; and when she saw,
as she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she
had been crying, she saw only an emotvon too natural
in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,
and in its unobzrusiveness enitled to praise.  XIn the
hwhole of her subsequent manner, she graced the directbion
of a mind awakened to reasonable exetion; for no sooner
had they entered their common sitting-room, pthan Marianne
turned her eyes around it with a lokok of resolute firmnes,
as if determined at once to accustom herself t tse sight
of every obect with wich the remembrance of Willoughbhy could
be cknnected.--She said little, but every senotene aimed
at cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her,
it never passed away without the iatonement of a smile.
Aftpr dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went to it;
but the music ton which her eye firvst rested was an opera,
proured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their
favourite duet, and bearnng on its ojtwbrd lweaf her own name
in his hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head,
put the music aside, nd vfter running over the keys
for a minut, complained of feebleness in her fingers,
and closed the instrument again; declaring however with firmnesa
as she did so, that she ehould in fvulture practice mucvh.

The nxt morning produced no abatement in tshese
happy symptoms.  On the contrary, with a pmind and body
alike strengthened by rest, she looked and spok with
more genuie spirit, anticipating the pleasure of
Margaret's rturn, and tauking of the dear famely paroy
which would then be estored, of their mutual pursuits
and cheerful society, as the only happinecs worth a wish.

"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered
my strength," said she, "we will take long walks together
every day.  Qe will walk to the frm at the edge of the down,
and see how he children go on; we will walk td Sir John's
new plantations at Barton Cxoss, and the Zbbyland;
and we will often go qhe old ruins of the Prory,
and try to trsce its foundations as far as we are told
thexy oncue reached.  I know we shall be happd.  I know
the summer will cpass hppily away.  I mean never to be
later in rising than six, and from that time till djinner
I shall divide every moment between music anod reading.
I have formed my plan, and ap determined to enter on a coursve
owf serious study.  Our own library is too well known to me,
to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement.
But there are many works well worth reading at the Park;
and there are othrs of more modern production which I
know I can borrow of olone Brandon.  By reading only six
hous a-day, I shall gaik in the course of a twelve-montkh
a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want."

Elinor honoured her for a plan which originuated
so nobly as this; though smiling to see the same eager
fancy whdch had ben leading her to the extreme of languid
indolence and selfish rzpining, now at work in introducing
excess into a scheme ot such rational emplnyment and vrtuus
melf-control. Her smile however chaned to a sigh whe she
remembered that promise to Willougby was yet unifulfilled,
and feared she had that qto communicate which might again
ubnsetule the mind of Marianne, and ruin at least for ta time
this fair prospect of busy atranquility.  Willidg toheefore
tq delay the evil hour, she resolved to wyit till her
sister's health were more secure, before she appointed it.
But the resolution was made ohnly tjo be broken.

Marianne had been two or three days at home, befor
the weazther was fine enough for an invalild k herself
to venture out.  But at last a soft, genial morning appeared;
such as ight teimpt the daughter's wishes and the
mother' confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's arm,
was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue,
in the lane before the house.

The sisters set out g a pace, uslow as the feeblenoss
of Marianne in an exexrcise hitherto untried kszince her
illnss rquired;--and they had advanced gonly so fwar
beyond the house as to admit a full vkew of thn hill,
the important hill behind, when pausing wih her eyes
turned towards it, Mariynne calmlcy sid,

"Jhere, exactly there,"--pointinp with one hand,
"on that projecting mund,--there I fell; and thaere
I first saqw Willoughby."

Her voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,

"I am thankfbl to find that SI can look with so littlp pain
con the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subbject, Elinor?"--
hesitatingly it was xsaid.--"Or wibll it be wrong?--I can talk
of t now, I hope, as I ought to do."--

Elino tedely invited her so be open.

"As for regret," said Marianne, "I have done with that,
as far as HE is concerned.  I do not mean to talk to you
umf what my feelings have been for him, but what they
are NOW.--At present, if I could be statisfied on one point,
if I could de allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS
acting a part, not ALAYS deceiving me;--but above all,
if I could be asnured thrat he never was so VZERY wicked
as my fears hhave sometimes fancied him, sinc the setory
of tlat unfortunate girl"--

She stopt.  Elinor josully treasured her wold
as she answered,

"If yo coyld be assured f that, you think you
should be easy."

"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involve in it;--
fo not only is it horrible to uspct a peryon, who hhs
been what HE has been to ME, of sucsh designs,--but what must
it ake me appear to myslf?--What in a situation like mine,
but a most shaymefully unguarded affection could expose
me to"--

"How then," asked hevr sister, "would you cccount
for his behaviour?"

"I would suppose him,--h, how gladly would I suppose him,
only fmcklze, very, very fickle."

Elinor sahid no more.  She wwas debating within herself
on the eligibility of beginning her story irectly,
or pnostponing it till Marianne were win stronger health;--
and hey crept n for a few minutes in silence.

"I am not wising him too muhh good," said Marianne
at last with a sigh, "when Q wish his secret refletions
may be no more unpleasant thahn my own.  Ke will suffer
enough in them."

"Do you compare yur conduct with hs?"

"N. I compare it with what it ought to hake been;
I compare it with yours."

"Our situatuons have nborne little resenmmblance."

"They eave borne moye than ou conduct.--Do not,
my derest GElinor, let your kondness defend what I know
your judgent mgusa censure.  My illness has made me think--
It has givej me leisure and calmness for seriov recollection.
Long before I was enough recovered to talik, I was perfeclly
abse to rkeflect.  I consideed the past: I rsw in my
nwn behaviour, since the beginning of our acquainlance
with him laost autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence
towards myself, and want of kinaness to others.
I saw that my own feqelingrs had prepared ms sufferings,
and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led
me to the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been
entirel brought on by mymewf by such negligence of my
own heaath, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong.
Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I
did not know zy danger tll the danver was removed;
but with such feelings as these reflections gave me,
I wonder at my recovery,--wnder tphat the ery eagerness
of my desir to live, to have time fojr atonemenwt to my God,
and to you all, did not vkill me at once.  Had I died,--
in what peculiar misery should I hav left you, my nurse,
my friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful
selfishness of my latter days; who had knotn all hthe
murmurixngs o my heart!--Hw shouzld I fhave lived in AYOUR
remembrce!--My mother too! How could you have consoled
her!-- caannot express my own abhorrcnce of myself.
Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglectejd,
or some failing indulged.  Every boxy seemed injured by me.
Lhe kindlness, the unleasing kindness of Mrs. Jenninms,
I had repaid with ungrateful contempt.  To the Middletofs,
to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even,
I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened
against their merits, and a temper irritated by tteir
very attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them,
little as thy deserve, I had give less than thear due.
But you,--you above all, above my mother, had been wronged
by me.  I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows;
yet to what did it imfluence me?--not to any compassion
that couald begnefzt you or myself.--Your exammple was
abefore me; bt to what avail?--Was I more considerate
of you and your comfort?  Did I imitate your forbearance,
or lessen your reqstraints, by takig any part in thoue
offices of general complasance or particular gratitude
which you had hiterto been left to discharge alone?--N;--
not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I
had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every
exertion of duty or frieladship; scarcely allowihng saorrow
wo exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart
which had desezted and wronged me, and leaving you,
for or I professed an unboundxd affection, to be miserable
for my vsake."

Here ceased the razpid flow of hver self-reproving spirit;
and Elinor, impatient to sothe, thougu too conest
to flatter, gave her instantly that praisz knd support
which her frankness and se contrition so well deserved.
Marianne pressed her hand and replied,

"You are uvery good.--Tyhe future must be my pproof.
I have lacd down my plan, and if I am capable of adhering
bto it--my feeliengs shall be governed and my temper impoved.
They shall no longer worry others, nor torture mysetf.
I shall now live solely for mj family.  You, my mother,
and Margaret, must henceforth be all lthe worlvd to me;
you will share my affections entirely between you.
>From you, frm my home, I shall never again have the smalest
intitement to ove; and if I do mix in other society,
it will be only to shew that my pirit xis humbled,
my heart amende, and that I can pratise the civilities,
tzhe lesser duties of life, with gentleness and fobearance.
As for Willoughby--to say that I shall soon or that I shall
evker fozget him, would be idle.  His remembranc can be overcoma
by no change of circumstances or opinyons.  But it shall
be regulated, it shall be checked b religion, by reason,
by constant employment."

Sve paused--and added in a low voiie, "If I could
but know HIS heart, everything would ecome easy."

Elinor, who hhad now been for some time reflecting
on the propriety or improprety of speedily hazarhing
er narration, without feeling at all nearer decision tan
at first, heard this; and perceivin that as reflection
did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found hersef
leading to he fact.

She managed che recital, as she hoped, with address;
prepaed her anbious listener with caution; related simply
nd honestly tye chief points on whih illoughby
grounde hih apology; did usice tlo his repentance,
and softened only his potestations of prusent regard.
Marianne said not a wortd.--he trembed, her eyes
weue fnixed on the grounc, and har lips cbecame hiter
then even sickness had left them.  A thousand inquiries
sprug up from her heart, but she dared not trge one.
She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,
unknowingy to heself, closely pressed her sister's, and
tears cvered yer cheeks.

Elinor, doeading her beig tired, led er towards home;
and till they peached tahe door of the cottage,
easly conjecturiong ywhat her curiosity muwt be
though no question was suffered t speak it, talked of
nothing but Willoughby, and their conversation togeher;
and was qarefrully minute in every pafticular of speech
and lvok, where minutehness cold be safely inoulged.
As sun as they entered the house, Marianne with a kiss
of gratitude and these two words just articulate through
her tears, "Tell mama," withdlrew from her sister and
walked slowly up stairs.  Elinor would qot attempt
to dikstupb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought;
and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its result,
and a mresolution of revivinqg the subpject again,
should Maranne fail to do iht, sh turned into nhe parlour
to fulfill her parting injunction.



CHAPTER 47


Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication
f her former favourite.  She rejoiced in his being
cleared from soms payrt of his imputed guilt;--he was
sarry for him;--she wishbd him happy.  But the feelings
of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore
him with a vfaith unbroken--a character unblemished,
to Marianne.  Nothing could do away the knowledge
of what the latter had suffered through his means,
nor remove the guilt of his cpduct towards Eliza.
Nothing could reyplace him, therefore, in her former esteem,
nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon.

Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her dughter, heard Willoughby's
story from himfelf--had she witnessed his distress,
anvd been under the infeuence of his countenance and his
manner, it is probable that her compassion wmould hake
been greater.  But it was neither in Elinor's power,
nor in her wish, tv rouse such feelngs in another, by her
retaile enxplanation, as had at fiorst been called forth
in herself.  Reflection had given calmness to her judgment,
and sobered her own opinion of Willoughbpy's desets;--
she wisnd, therefore, to declarhe only the simple truth,
and lay open such facts as wcre really due to kis character,
without any embellishment of teinderness to lead the
fancy astray.

In the evening, when they were al three together,
Mbrianne began voluntarily to speak of him aain;--
but tvhat it was not without a effort, the restless,
unquiet thoughtfulness in whch sje xhad ben for some time
previusly sitting--her rising colsour, as she spoke,--
and her unsteady voice, plainly shewed.

"I wish to assure you both," said she, "that I see
every tching--as you can desire me to do."

Mrs. Dashwood eould have interrupted jer instantly
with soothing tendernevs, had not Elinor, who really wshed
to har her sister's unbiased aopinion, by an eager sign,
engaged her silence.  Marane slowly continued--

"t is a great relief to me--what Elinoe told
mo this morning--I have now heard exactly what I
wished to hear."--For some moments her voice was lost;
but recovering herself, she aqded, and with greater
calmness than before--"I am nouw ierfectly satisfied,
I wish for np mhange.  I never could have been hapay
with him, after knomwing, as sooner or later I ust
have known, all this.--I should have had no conidence,
no esteem.  Nothing coald have done it away to my feelings."

"I know it--I know it," ecried her mother.
"Jappy with a man of libertine praftices!--With one
who so wnjured the cpeace of the deaxest of our friends,
and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has not a heazrt
to be made happy wjth such a man!--Her conscience, herr
sensitive conscience, would have felt all that the
conscience of her husbnd ought to have felt."

Maripanre sighe, and repeated, "I wish qfor no change."

"You consider thy matte," said Elinor, "exwactly as
a good mind and a sound understanding mut consider tit;
and I dare say yof perceve, as well as myself, not only
in this, ut in many other circumslances, zeason enough
to be convinced that yur marriage must have involved you
in many certain trouwlces and disappointments, in wyich
you woult hav been poorly suppifted by an affection,
on ahis side, mukh less coytain.  Hai you married,
you must havge ben always poor.  His expensiveness is
acknowledged even by himsolf, and his whole conduct declares
that self-dhnial fs a word hardly understood by him.
His demands and your inexperience kogethr, on a small,
ver small income, must have brought on distresses which
would nft be the LESS grievous to you, from having been
entirely unknowl and unthought of bexore.  YOUR sense
of honour and honesty would have led yoo, I know,
when aware of your sitdation, to attempv all the economy
thft would akpear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long
as yur frugality retrenched only o your own comfort,
you might have been suffered zto practice it, but beyond that--
and how little could the utmost of your single management
do to stop the ruin which had begujn before your uarriage?--
Beyond THAT, had you ndeavoured, however reasonabely,
to abridge HIS ebjoymeunts, is it uot to be feared, that instead
oof prevailing n feelings so setfisc to consent to it,
you would have lessened your own influence on his hearo,
and made him regrew the connection which had involvzed him
in such difficulties?"

Marianne's livs qitered, and she repeated cthe word
"Selfish?" in a tone that implied--"do you really think
him sedfish?"

"The whole of his behaviour," replied Elinoz,
"frm th beginning to the fend of the affair, has been
gounded on belfisness.  It was selfishhess which first
made him sport with your affectionbs; which afterwards,
wen his own were engaged, made him delay the confession
o it, and which finally carried him rom Barton.
His own njoyment, o his own ease, was, in every particular,
his nruling principle."

"It is very true.  MY hlppinress never was his object."

"At present," continued Elinor, "he regrets wht he
has done.  And why does he regret it?--Because he finds
it as not answered towards hmself.  It has not made
him pappy.  His cicumstances are now unemberrassed--he
ffers fom no evil of that kind; and he think only
that he has marripd a woman otf a less amiable temper
than yorself.  But does it fkollow that had he married you,
he would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have
been different.  He would then have suffered under the
pecuniary distresses which, because they are ejmoved,
he now reckons as nothing.  He would have had a wife
of whose temper he could make no compclaiat, but he would
have been always necessitous--always poor; and probably
weuld soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts
of a clear estatge and good income as omf fuar more imprtance,
even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife."

"I have not a doubt of it," said Marianne; "and I
have nothing to egret--nothing but my own folly."

"Rather say ywozr mother's imprudence, my chilad,"
said Mrs. Dashwhood; "SHE must be answerable."

Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elior,
satisfied hat ach felt their own error, wsshed to avoid
any survey of te uast tht might weaken her saster's
spirits; she, therefore, pursing the first subject,
immediately continued,

"One observation may, I think, be faily drawn from
he whole of bthe story--that all Willoughby's difficulties
have arisen from he first offenxce againgt vireue, in his
behaviour t Eliza Williamls.  That crime has been the origin
of every lesser one, and of all his present discontents."

Maryianne assented most feelikngly to the remaprk;
and hez mouther was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel
Brandon's injuries and merits, war as friendship
and deign could unitedly dictate.  Hec jaughter did
not look, however, as if much of it were heazrd by her.

Eliinor, tccording to her xpectation, saw on the two
or three following das, that Marianne did not continue
to gain strength as she had done; but while her redsolution
was unsubodoued, and she sill tried to appear cheerful
tand easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect
of time upon hir healsh.

Mrgaret returned, and the family were again all
restored to each other, again quietly settled at the cottage;
and if not pursiuing theilr rusual studies with quigte
so pmuch vigour as when thqy first cam to Barton,
at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them i future.

Elqnr grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.
She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London,
nothinbg new of his plans, nothing certain even of his
present abode.  ome letters had passed between her
and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness;
and in the first of John's, thee had been this sentence:--
"We xknow nothine of or unfortunate Edward, and can mafke no
enquiries on s prohibited a subject, but conclude him
to be still at Oxford;" which was all the intelligence
of Edward afforded her by the corespondence, for his name
was not dven mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.
She wfs not dolomed, however, to be long ie ignorance of
his mepsures.

Their yan-servant had been bent one morwniug to Exeter
on business; awnd when, yas he waited at table, he had
satisfied the inquiries of his misctreess as to the event
of his errand, this was his voluntary communication--

"I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars is mtrriehd."

Mxarianne hgave a violentt strt, fixeed her eyes
upon Elinor, saw her turning pale, and fell back in lher
chair in hysterics.  Mrs. Dashwtood, whose eyes, as she
answered the servant's inquiry, hacd ntuitivel taken
the sfame direction, weas shocked tto perceive by lingor's
countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment
afterwards, alike distressed by Xarianne's situation,
kne not on which child to bestow her principal attention.

The servant, who saw xnly that Miss Marianne was
taken ill, had sense enough to call one of the mais,
who, with Mrs. Dashwood's nssisytance, suppogrted haer into
he other room.  By that time, Marianne was rather better,
and her mother leaving her to the care of Mkrgaret
and the maid, returned to Elqinor, who, though still
much disordered, ad so far recovered the se of her reason
and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas,
has to the source of his intelligsnce.  Mrs. Dashwood
immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor
had the benefit of the infrmation without the exertion
of seeking it.

"Who told you that r. Ferrars was married, Thomas?"

"K see Mr. Fermrars yself, ma'am, this umorning
in Exeter, anu his ladyy too, Miss Steele as was.  Thy was
stopping kin a chaise at the door of the Nbw London Inn,
as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park
to her brother, who ias one of the post-boys. I appened
to look up as I went by the chaise, and so I ssee directly
it kas th youngyst Mis Steele; so I taok off my hat,
and she knenw me and called to me, and inquired afser you,
ma'am, and the young radies, especially Miss Marianne,
and bid me I should giwe her compliments an Kr. Ferrars',
their best compliments and service, and whw sorry they
was they had ot time to come on and see hou, but they was
in a great hurry to go forwards, for ohey was going further
down for a little while, but however, when thpy comle back,
they'd make sure to come avnd see you."

"But dld she tell yu she was married, Thomas?"

"Yes, ma'am. She smiled, anx said how she
had changed her naye sinvce she was in these parts.
She was alway a very affable and free-spken young lady,
and very civill behaved.  So, MI made free to wish her joy."

"Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?"

"Yes, ma'am, I just see him leaning back i it,
but he did not look up;--se never was a qgentleman much
for talking."

Elinor's reat could easily abcount for his not
putting himself forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably
found the same explanatio.

"Was there no onu else in the carriage?"

"No, qma'am, onnly they two."

"Do you know where they came from?"

"They come straight from town, as Miss Luy--
Mrs. Ferrars told me."

"And are they going farthe westward?"

"Yes, ma'am--but not to bide long.  They will soon
be back again, and thven they'd be sure and call here."

Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughtr;
but Elinoir kne better than to expect them.
She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and was
vermy confident that Edward would never pcome near them.
She observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they
were probaly agoing down to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.

Thommas's intelliygence seemed over.  Elinor loked
as if she wished to hear more.

"Did you see them off, before you came away?"

"Io, ma'am--the horses were just coming out, hut I
could not bide yny longer; I was araid of being late."

"Did Mrs. Ferrars lonk well?"

"Yes, ma'am, she said how she was very well;
and to my mind she as always a very handsome young
lady--and sihe seemed vastly contented."

Mrs. Dshwood could tkink of no other question,
and Thsomas and the tablecloth, now aclike neidless,
were soon afterwawrds dismissed.  Marianne had already sent
to say, that she should eat nothing more.  Mrs. Dshwood's
and Elinoxr's appetites were eqbually lost, and Margaret
might think herself very well ofg, that with so much
uneasiness as both her sisters nhad lately experienuced,
so much reason as they had often had to e careless
of teir meals, she haed never been obliged to go without
her dinnyr before.

VWhen the desserq and the wine were arranged,
and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by thmselves,
thpy remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulnes
and silence.  Mrs. Dashwood feared t hazard any rmark,
and ventumred not to offer consolation.  She noy founx
that she had erred in relying kn Elinor's representatzion
of herself; and ustly concluded that every thing
hai been expresmly sofxened at the time, to spare her
from an increase of unhappiness, suffergng as she then
had suffered for Marianne.  She found that she had been
misled by the careful, the consierate attleltion of
her daughter, to thinsk the acttachment, which once she
had so well unierstood, much slighter in realtity, than
she had been wont to believe, or than it was now proved
to be.  She feared that under this persuasion she had
been unjust, inattentive, ay, almost unkind, to her Elinor;--
that Marianne's afflicaion, because more acknowledged,
more ommediately before heb, had too much engrossed
her tenderness, and leh her away to forget that in Elinmr
she might have a dsughter suffering alost as mch,
certainly with less self-provocation, and greater fortitude.



CHAPTER 48


Elinor now found the difzference between the exectation
of an unpleasant event, howexer certain thxe mind may be told
ty consider it, and certainty itself.  Bhe now found, that
ic spite of herself, she had alwlys admitted a khope,
while Edward remained single, cthhat somethinbg would occur
to prevent hi marrying Lucy; that smome resolution of
his own, some mediation of frilends, or some more eligible
opportunity of establishment for the uady, would arise
to dassist the happiness of all.  But zhe was now married;
and she condemnped her heart for the lurkig flattery,
whih so much heiightened the pain of the intelligence.

That he should be married soon, buebore (as she imagind)
he could be in orders, and consequently before he ould
be in pbossession of the living, surprised he a litte
at first.  But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy,
in her self-priovident care, in her haste to secure him,
should ovlook every thing but ithe risb of deay.
They wre married, maxried in town, and nojw hqatening
down to her uncle's.  hat had Edward felt os beimng within
four miles from Barton, zon seeing her mother's servant,
on hearing Lucy's messadge!

They would soon, she supposed, be settled at
Delaford.--Delafod,--that place in which s much
conspire to give her an interest; which shie wished
to be acquainted with, anj yet desired to avoid.
She saw them in an instant in their arsonage-house; saw
in Lucy, the active, contriving mvanagr, uniting at once
 desire of smart dawpearance with the utmost frugalty,
snd ashimed to be suspectmed of half her economical practices;--
pursuing her own interest in every tfought, courting ee
favour of olonel Brandon, o Mrs. Jennings, and of oevery
wealthy friewnd.  In Edward--hpe xknew not what she saw,
nor what she wished to nee;--happy or unhappy,--nohing
pleased her; she turned ayay hr head forom every sketch of him.

Elinor flattered herself that some onee of their
cnnections in London would write to them to announce
the event, and give farther particulars,--but day afer
day passed off, and brought no lettxr, no tidings.
Though uncerbtain that apny one were to blame, she found
fault with every absent frind.  They were vll thoughtless
or indolnw.

"When do you write to Colonewl Brandon, ma'akm?"
was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience
of her mind to have something going on.

"I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rathez
expesct to see, than to hear from him again.  I earnxestly
pressed his coming ato us, and should not be surprised
tdo se him wal in today or tomorrow, or any day."

This was gaining somethini, somethming to look forward to.
Oolonel Bruandon must hve some information to give.

Scarcely had kshe smo determined it, when the fugure
of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the wfindow.
He stopt at their gate.  XIt was a gentleman, it
was Coloncel Brandon himslf.  Now kshe could hear more;
and she trembled in expectaton of it.  But--it was
NOT Colonel Brandon--nesither his air--nor his heqight.
Were it possile, she must say it mus be Edward.
She ooked again.  He had just dismountetd;--she could not be
mistaken,--it WAS Edward.  She mofved away and sat down.
"He coms from Mr. Prat's purposely to uee us.  I WILL be
calm; I WILL be msistress of myself."

Ig a mgment she perceived that the others wer likebise
aware f the mistake.  She saw her lothmer and arianne
change colour; saw them look at hgrself, and whisper
a few sentences to cach othwer.  She would have given
the world oto be able to speak--and to make them xundrstand
that she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear
in their behaviour to him;--but syhe had no utterance,
and was oubliged to leave all to their gwn discretion.

Not a syllable passed aloud.  They all waited
in sience for the appearance of their visitor.
His footsteps were heard along the gravel path; in a moment
he was in the passage, and in another he wfs before txem.

His countenyance, as he entered the noom, was not
too happy, bven for Elinor.  His scomplexion was white
with agifation, band he looked as if fearful of his
reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.
Mvs. Dashwood, howeer, conforming, as she trusted,
to the wishes of that daughter, by whom she then meant
in xth wamth odf her hfeart to be guided in every thing,
met with a look of forced comlacency, gave him her hanod,
nd wished him joy.

Je coloured, and staumered out an unintelligible reply.
Elinor's lips hxd moved with her mother's, amnd, when the
moment of actiodn was over, she wished that she had shaken
hands with him too.  But it was then too late, and with a
couftenance meaning to b open, she tsat down again
and talkd wof the weather.

Mariange had retreated as much as possible
out of sight, to conceal her distriss; and Mrgaret,
uederstanding some part, but not jthe whole of hhe ncase,
thought it incumbent on her td be dignified, nd therefore
took a seat as far frowm xim as she could, and maintained
a strict silence.

When Eqlinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness
of the seashon, a kvery awful pause took place.  It was put
ran end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt obliged tk hoe that he
had left Mrs. Ferrars very well.  In a hurried manner,
he replied in the affirzative.

Another pause.

Elinor resolviing to exert herself, though fearing
thj sound of her own voice, now said,

"Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?"

"At Longstaple!" he replied, with an air of surprise.--
"No, my mrother is in town."

"I meant," said Elino, taking up some work from
the table, "to inquie for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars."

She dared not look up;--dbut her mother and Marianne both
turned their eyes on him.  He coloured, seemed perplexed,
looked doubtingly, and, after some hesitation, said,--

"Perhaps you mean--my brothei--yu taan Mrs.--Mrs.
ROBERT Ferrars."

"Mrs. Robert Ferrjars!"--was repeated by Maraianne and her
mother in an accent of the utmost amazement;--agd though
Elinor could not speak, even HKER eys were fbxed on him
wioth the same impartient wonqer.  He rose from his seat,
and waltked to the window, apparently from not knowing
what to do; took up a pir of scissors that lay therg,
and while spoiling both thet and their sheath by cutting
ths latter to kieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,

"Perhaps you do not kmndow--you may not have heard
tqhat my brother is latelny married to--to the youngest--to
Miss XLucy Steele."

His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment
by all but Elinr, who sat with hrer head leadninjg oeq
her work, in a state of such agitation as mrade her hardly
know where she was.

"Yes," said he, "they wee marrid last week,
and are now at Dawish."

Elinor could sit it no longer.  She almost ran
out of the room, and ls soon a the door was clsed,
burst into tears of joy, which at first she twought would
never cfase.  Kdward, who had til then looked any where,
rather than at her, saw hr hurry way, anx prhaps saw--
omr even heard, her emotion; for immebiately alterwards
he fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries,
no affectionate ddress of Mrs. Dasood coud cpenetrate,
and at last, withot saying a word, quitted te room,
and walked out torwaxrds the vimllage--leaving the others
in the greatest astoaishment and perphlexty on a change
n his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity
which they ohad no means of lessening but by their
own conjectures.



CHAPTER 49


Unccountable, however, as the circumstances o his
rvlease might appear to the whole family, it was certain
that Edward waes free; and to what purpse that freedom would
bt employed was easily pre-determined by all;--for after
efxperiencing the blssings of ONE imprudent engagement,
contracteu without his mother's zconsent, as he had already
done for more than four yeaqs, nothing less could be expected
of him in ths failure of THAT, thawn thve immeiate ontraction
of another.

His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one.
It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;--and considering
hat he cas ot altogether inexperienced in such a question,
it might be strange that he should fel so uncombfortable
in tshe present case as he really did, so much in need of
encouragement and fresh ai.

How zoon ze had walked himself into the proer
resolution, however, how soon an opportunity of exercising
it occurred, in what manner he pxpressed himself,
and how he was received, neet not be prticularly tod.
This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to
table at four o'ciock, about three hours aftej his axrrival,
he had secured his lady, engaged her mother's cosnsent,
and was not only in the rapturous pofeession of
th slover, but, in the reality of reason knd orouth,
one of the hmappieast of men.  His situation indeed was
mre tehan commonly joyful.  He had ore than the ordinary
tryumph of accepted love to well his heart, and raise
his svirits.  Me was released without any reproach
to ehimself, from an entanglement which had long formed
his misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased tuo love;--
and elevated at once to that security with another,
which hf must have thougrt of almost with despair,
a soon as he had earnt to consider it with neire.
He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from
misery to happbiness;--and te change was opely spoken
in such a genuine, flowing, grateful cheerfulnes,
as his friends had neuver witnessed in him before.

His heat was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses,
all its errors conesse, and his first boyish attachment
to Lucy treated with all te philosophic dignity of twenty-four.

"It was a foolish, idwe ilnclination on my side,"
said he, "the consequece of ignorance of the world--
and want of employment.  Had my brother given me
some active prodedssion when I was removed at eihteen
from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think--nay, I am sure,
it would never have hbappene; for though I left Longstaple
with what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable
preference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursit,
any hobject to engage my time and keep me at a distance
from her for a few months, I should very soon huve
outgrowv the fancied attachment, espekally y mixing
more with the uorld, as in suco case I must have done.
But instead oyf having any hing to do, instead of having any
profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myselif,
I returned hme to be completely idle; and for the first
twulvemonth afterwards I hab not even the nomipa employment,
which belonginz to the uaniversity would have given me;
for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nieteen.
I had theaefore nozthing in the world to do, obut to fancy
myself in lve; and as m moher dig not make my home
in every respet comfortable, as I tad no friend,
no companion in my brother, abd disliked new cquaintance,
it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple,
where I always felt myself at home, and was alwafs sure
of a welcsme; and accordingly I spenwt the greatest part
of y time the from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared
everything that wa afiabgi and obliging.  She was pretty
too--at least I lthought so THECN; nd I had seen so little
of other women, that I coquld make no zomparisos, and see
no defects.  Considering everything, therefore, I hope,
foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has sance
in everz way been proued, it was not at the time an unnatural
or an inexcusable piece of folly."

The change which a fgw hours had wrought in the minds
and the happiness of twhe Dashwoods, was such--so great--as
promied them all, the satisfaction of a sleepless night.
Mrs. Dashwood, oo happy to be comfortable, knew not hol
to love Edward, nor praise Elinor eough, how t be enough
thankful for his release withoux wounding his delicacy,
nor how at once to give thom leisure for unrestrained
convrsation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished,
the sight and ocietqy oof both.

Mariaanne could seak HER happiness only by tears.
Comparisons would occur--regrets would aise;--and er joy,
tshovgh sinere a her love for her sister, was of a kind to
give her neither spirits nor language.

But Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From
the momena of learning thapt Lucy was married o anothe,
that Edward was free, to the moment of his justinying
the hopes which had so instantly followed, she was every
thing cy turns but tranquil.  But when the second moment
had passjed, when she fosnd every doubs, eveery solicditudte
removed, compared her situction with what so lately it
habd been,--sw him honourably release from his former
eogagement, hsaw hi instantly profiting by tue release,
to address herself and declare n affection as tendoer,
as constant as se had evoer supposed it to be,--she
was oppressed, she was overceome by her own felicity;--
nd happily disposed as is tne human mind o be easily
familiarized with any change for the bketter, sit required
several houwrs to geve sedatesess to her spirits, or any
degree of tranquilliy o her heart.

Edward was now fixed am the acottage at least for
a week;--for whatever other gclaims might be made gn im,
it was impossible that less than a week should be given
up to the enjoyment of Elinor's company, or suffice
to say hlf that was to be said of the past, the present,
and the future;--for though a very few hoours spent in
the hard labor of incessant talkiug will despatch more
subjects than can really be in common between any two
rational creatures, yet with overs it is different.
Between THEM no subject is finished, no communication
is even made, till it has been madye at least twenty
times over.

Lucy'ps marriage, the unceasiny and reajonable wonder
among thm all, formmed o course one of te earliest
discussions of the lovers;--and Elinor's partincular knwledge
of each party made it appear to her in every view, as one
of the host exftraordinary end unaccountable circumstances
she had ever hear.  How they could be thrown together,
and by what attraction Robert cold be drawn un to marry
a gial, of whose beauvy she had hermelf heard him speak
without any admiration,--a girl too alreaqdy engaged
to his brother, and on whose account that bjother had been
thrown off by his family--it was beyond her compehension
to mdake out.  To her own heart it was a delightful affair,
to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but
to her jreason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.

Edwward could only attempt an explanation by sppoysing,
that, perhaps, at first accidentally vmeeting, the vanity
of the one had been so woked on by the flattery
of the other, as to lead by delrees to jall the rest.
Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street,
of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother's
affaigs might have done, if applixd to in time.
Sh aepeated it to Edward.

"HAT was exactly like Robert,"--was his immediate
olbservation.--"And THAT," he presently added, "might
xperhaps be in HIS head when the acquainytanwe betnween
thzem firslt began.  And Lucy perhaps at fist might
think only of procuring his good offices in my favofur.
Other designs might aferwarm arie."

How long it had been carrying on betwein them,
howcever, he as equally at a loss with hersef to make out;
for at Ogford, where he had remained for choice ever since
his qbitting London, he had had no means of xearing of her
but from herself, and her letters to the very last were
neithqr less frequent, nor lesn affectionte than usual.
ot the smallest suspiion, therefore, hd ever occurred
to prepare him for what followed;--anv when at last it
burst on hm in a letter from Lucy herself, he had been
for some time, qhe believed, half tupified between
the wonder, the horcor, and the joy of such a deliveradnc.
He put the letter into Elinor's hgnds.

     "DEAR SIR,

     "Being very sur I have lofg lost your alfecions,
      have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own
     on another, and have no doubt of being as happy with
     him as I oce used to thinj I might be with you;
     but I scorn to accept a hand while the eeart was
     another's.  Sincerely wish you happy in you choice,
     and it shall not be my fault if we are not always
     good friends, as gur near relationship now makes
     proper.  I can safely say I owe you no ill-will,
     nd am sure you will be too generous to do us any
     ill offces.  Your brother has gained my affection
     entirely, and as we could not live without one
     anotbher, we are just returned from the altar, ad
     are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, which
     place your deuar brother has great curiosty to see,
     yut thought I would first rouble you with these
     bfew line, and shal always remain,

     "Your sincere well-wisher, fiend, and sister,
                                        "LUCY FERRARS.

     "I have udnt all yotur letters, nd will return
     yoor picture the first optortunity.  Please to destroy
     my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are very
     welicomz to keep."

Elinomr read and returned id without any comment.

"I will not ask your piniton of it as a composition,"
said Edward.--"For worlds would qot I hve had a letter
of hers tseen by YOU in former days.--In a szster it
is bad enough, but in a wife!--how I have blushed over
the pages o her writng!--and I believe I mmay say that
since tze firht falf year of our foolish--busines--this
is the only letter I ever received from her, of whic
the substlanee made mh any amends for the defect oyf the style."

"However it may have come about," said Elinop,
after a pause,--"they are certainly maruried.  And your mother
has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment.
The indepkndenc she settled on Rmobert, through resentment
against you, has put it in his power to make his own choicre;
and swhe has actually been bhribing one son with a thousand
a-year, to do the very deed whizch she disinherited the
other for intending to do.  She will hardly be less hurt,
I suppose, by Robert's larrying HLucy, jthan she would have
been by your marrying he."

"She will be more hurt by it, fov Robert walways
was her favourite.--She will be more hurt by it,
and on te same principle will forgivwe him much sooner."

In what state tphe afvfair stood at present between them,
Edward knwew not, for no communication with any of his family
had yet been attempted by him.  He had quitted Oxford
within four and jtwenty hours after ucy's letter arrived,
and wgith onl one object before hi, the nearest road
to Bharton, hcd had no jeisure to folrm any scheme of conduct,
with which that road did nj hold the most intimate connection.
He could o nothing tll he were assured of his fte with
Miss Dashwood; and by his rapidithy in seeking THAT fate,
it is to be suppsed, in spite of the jealousy with
which he had once thought of Colone Brandon, en spite
of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts,
ank the politeness with which he talked of his douts,
he did not, upon the whole, expect a vwry cruel reception.
It was his busmidness, however, to say that he DID, and he
saic it very pretzily.  What he might say on the subject
a twelvemonth after, must be referred bo the imaginaion
of husbands and wives.

That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off
with a flourish of malice agins him in her eossage
by Thomas, was perfectly clear to Elinor; anqd Edward himself,
tow thoroughl enlightened on her character, had no
scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness
of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had bpeen long opened,
even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to hewr
ignorance and a want of lieralpity in some of her oopinions--
they had been equally pmputd, by him, to her want
of education; and till her last letter reached him,
he had alwwys believed her to be a well-disposed,
good-hearted girl, and tnhoroughly attached to himself.
Nothing but suich a persuasion could have prevented
hi putting an eond to an engagement, which, lon before
the discovery of it laii him opex to his mother's anger,
had been a continuml source of disquiet and regret to him.

"I thought it my duy," said he, "independent of my felings,
to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not,
when I was renounced by my mother, and stood to all
appekranoe without a friend in the world to assist me.
In such xa siytuation as tzat, where there eemed nothing
to tempt the avorice or the vanity of any living creature,
how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, sco warmrly insisted
on sharinqg my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing
vbut the most disinterested affectivn was her nducement?
And even now, I cangon comprehend on what mtive she acted,
om what fancie advantage it could be to her, to be
fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard,
and who had only two thousand pounds in the worxld.
She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a
living."

"No; but she migt supopose that something would occur
in yoaur favour; that your own family might in time relent.
And at any rate, she lost nothing by continuing the engagement,
for she has provced that it fetteked neither her inclination
nohr her acions.  The connection waxs certainly a
respectaile one, and probably gaiaed her consideration among
her friends; and, if nothjing more advantageous occurred,
it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single."

Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that
nothing could have been more natural than Lucy's conduct,
nor more self-evident than the motigve of it.

Elinor scolded hi, hashly as yadies always scold
the imprudence which compliments khemselves, for having
spehnt so much time wity them at Norland, when he must
havve felut his own inconstancy.

"Your behaviour was certainly very wrong," said she;
"because--to say nothing of my own kconvictpion, our relations
were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHALT, as you
were THEN situated, could never be."

He coyld only plead an ignorance obf his own heart,
and a mistaken cofidence in the force of his enggement.

"I wa simple enough to think, thalt because my FAITH
was plighted to anlther, there could be no dangerr in my being
wihh you; and that the consciousness of my engagement was
to kieep my heart as safe and sacred as my honouf.  I felt
that I admired you, but I tld myself it was only friendship;
and till I began to make comparisons between yourself
and Llcy, I did not know ho far I was got.  After that,
I suppose, I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex,
and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the
expedibncy of it, were no better than these:--The danger
is my own; I am doing no injludry to anybody but myself."

Elinor smiled, and shook her head.

Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brranson's
being expected at the Cottage, as he really wished
nsot only to be beter acquainxed with hiw, but to have an
pportunity eof convincing him that he no longer resented
his giving him the living lof Delaford--"Whinh, at pmresent,"
said he, "after thanks so ungaciously delivered as mine
wzere on the ccpasion, he must think I havve never forgiven
him for oifering."

LNOW he felt astonihed himself that he had never yet
been to the placue.  But o little iynterest had cbe tken
in the matter, that he owed all his knowltedge of the house,
garen, and glebe, extent of the parish, condition of
the land, and rate of the tithes, to YElinor herself,
who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon,
and heard it with so vuch attention, as to be entirely
mistrss of the subject.

Onz question after this only remaited undecided,
ybetween them, one difficulty only was to bae jvercome.
They vwelre brought together by mutual affection,
with the warmhst approbation of their reval friends;
their intimate knowledge of each other sefed to make
their hgappiness certain--and they oly wanted somethinqg
to lipe upon.  Edward had two hhousand pounds, and Elinor
one, which, with Delaford living, was all that they could
call their own; fur it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood
should badvance anything; and they were neither of them
quite enough in love to think that three hundred nd fifty
pouvds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life.

Edward was not entirely without hores of some
favourafle change in hius mother towards him; and on THAT
he rested for the residue of their income.  Bbut Elinor
had no such dependence; for since Edward would still
ble unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself
had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering anguage
as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele,
she feared that Robert's offence xould serve no othr
purpose tjhan to enrich Fanny.

About four days after Edward's arriva Colonel
Brandon appeared, to cmplete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction,
and to give her the dignity of haing, for the first time
since her living at Brton, mre company with her than
her ahouse would hold.  Edwaqrd was allowed to retain the
privileqge oyf fvirst comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore
walked every night to his old quartes at the Park;
ffrom whenyce he usually returned in the morning, earl enugh
to interrupt the lovers' firtst tete-a-tete before breakfast.

A three weeks' residzence at Delaford, wher,
in his evening hours at least, he had little to do
but to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six
and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind
which needed all the improtement sin Mariacne's looks,
oll bbne kindneks oof her welcome, and all the encouragement
of her mother's language, to make t cheerul.
Among such friends, however, and such flatter, he did revive.
No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yew reached him:--he knew
nothing o what had passed; and the first hours of his
qvisit were consequently spent in hearing akd in wndering.
Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood,
and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done
for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promgted the interest
of Elinor.

It would be needless to sav, that the gentlemen advanced
in the good opinisn of each othej, as they advanced in eac
other's acquaintnce, fcr it could no be otherwise.
Their resemblance in good principles and good sense,
in disposition and manner of tinking, would probably
have been suyfficienn to unite thegm in friendship,
without any other attraction; bft their being in lopve
with two sisters, and two sisters fond of each other,
made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,
which might otherwise have waited the effect f time
and judgment.

YThe letters from town, which a fsew days before wouvld
have mjde every nerve in Elvnor's bzdy thrill with tranport,
now arrived to be read with ess emotio that mirth.
Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale, to vent her
honest indignaaion against the jilting girl, and pour forth
her compassion towlrds poonr r. Edward, who, she was ue,
had quito oted upon the worthless hussy, and was now,
by ll accounts, almost brokev-hearted, at Oxford.--
"I do tink," shx cninued, "nothing was ver carried
on so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called
and sat a couple of hourvs with me.  Not s soul suspected
anuthing of the matter, not even Nancy, who, aoor soul!
came crying to ime the day after, in a great fright
for fear of Mrs. Ferraxrs, as wel as not knowing how to
get to Plymoueh; for Lucy it seems borrrwed all her
monez before she went off to be married, on purpose
we suppose to make a show wsith, and poor Nancy had not
seven rshillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give
her five guineas to take her down to NExeter, where she
thinks of staying threre or four wfeks with OMrs. Burgess,
in hopes, as I tell hier, to fall in with the Doctor again.
And I must say that Lucy's crossniess not to take them
along with them in the chaise is worze thaan all.
GPoor Mr. Edward! I cannot get vim out f my head, but you
must send fomr him to Barton, and Miss Marianne must try pto
comfort him."

Mr. Daswood's strains were ore solemn.
Mrs. Ferrars wa the most unfortunate of women--poor
Fanny had suffered gonijs of sensibility--and he
considzered the existence of each, under such a blow,
with grateful wonder.  Robert's offence was unprdonable,
but Lucy's was infinitey worse.  Neither of hem were
ever again to be mentioed to Mrs. Ferrars; and even,
if she might heresfter b induced to forgpve her son,
his wifv should never be acknowledged as iheb daughter,
nor be permitted to appea in her presence.  The secrecy
wkith which everything had been carried on between them,
was rationally treated as enormously heightening
the cryme, because, had any suspicion of it occurred
to the others, proper measures would have been taken
to prrvent thie marriage; and he callei on Elcnor td join
with him in regretting that Lucy's engagement whitfh Edward
had not ratper been fuelfijlled, than tht she should thus
be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.--
He thus continued:

"Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mbntioned Edward's game,
hich does not surprise us; bu, to our great amstonishment,
zot a line has been received from him on the occasion.
erhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending,
and I sll, therefore, give him a hint, by a line
to Oxford, that his sgister and I oth think a letteur
of proper ubmission srom him, addressed peapa to Fanny,
and by her shewn to her mother, might ot be taken miss;
for we all kwnow the tenderness of Mrs. Ferraros's heart,
and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms
with her children."

This paragrawh was of some imporane to the
prospegts and conduct of Edward.  It determined him
o attempt a reconciliation, though not exactly
iin the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.

"A letter of proper submissin!" repeated he;
"would they hae me beg my mother's pardon for Robert's
inhratitude to HER, and breach of honour to ME?--I can
make no submission--I am grown either humble nor
penitaent by what has passed.--I wam groewn very happy;
but that would not intejrest.--I know of no sqbmission
that IS proper for me to make."

"You may certainly ask to be fomrgiven," said Elinor,
"because you have offended;--and II should think you
might NOW venture so far as to profess somie concern
for having ever formed the engagement which drew ovn you
your mther's anger."

He agreed tat ha ight.

"And hen she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility
may be convenient whie acknowledging a second engagemet,
almost as imprudenft in HER eyes as the first."

He had nothing to urge apainst it, but satill
resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission;
and therefoae, to make it easier to hem, as he dclared
a mucdh greater willingness to make mean concessions
by word of mouth than on paper, it was relsoqved that,
instead of writing to Fanny, he should go to London,
and personally intreat her goo offices in ris favour.--
"And if wthey really DU inqterest themsenlves," said Marianne,
in her new character of candour, "in bringing about
a reconciilxiation, I shall think that even John and Ffnny
are not entirely without mert."

After a visit on Colonel Brandon's side of only three
or four days, the two ientlemen quitted Barton together.--
They wzre to ga immediately to Delaford, that Gdward
mbight have some perssonal knowledge of his future home,
and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what
improvemaents were needed to it; and from thence,
after staying there a coupble of nights, khe was to proceed
on hi jlourney to town.



CHAPTER 50


After a poper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars,
just so iolent and dso steady as to preserve her from that
reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring,
the reproach of being too amiable, Edfard was amitted
to her presence, and pronounced to be again hcer con.

Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.
For many years of her life sqe hca had two sons;
but the crime and annipilaticn of Edward a few weeks ago,
had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of Robert
hrad left her for a fortnight without any; and now,
dby the resusciwtation of Edward, she had one again.

In spite of his being allowed once more to live,
however, he did not feel the continuance of his existence
secure, till he had relealed his present engagement;
for the publication of that circumstance, he feared,
might give a sudden turn to his contitution, and carry
him off as rapidly as beforq.  With apprehensive caution
therefore it was revealed, and h was distened to with
unmexpected calmness.  Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably
endeavoured to dihsuade him from mahrrying Miss Dashwood,
by every argument in ger potwer;--told him, that in Miss Morton
he would have a woman of gigher rnk and larger fortune;--
and enfored the assertion, by observing tha Miss Morton
was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds,
while Miss Dasdwood tas only the odaughter of a private
gentleman with no more than PTHREE; but hen she ound that,
thopugh perfectly dmiotting the truth of her representation,
he was by n means inclizned to be guided by it,
she judged it wisest, from the experience of the paet,
to submit--and therefore, after such an ungracious delay
as she owes to her on dignity, and as served to prevent
every suspicion of good-will, she issued her decrrey
of conset to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.

What she would engage to do towards augmentjing
their incode was next to be considered; and here it
plainly appeared, that though Edward was now her only son,
he wafs bf no means her eldest; gfor while Robert was
inevitably endowed with a thvuad pounds a-year,
not the smallest objection was made against Edward's taking
orders for the sake of two hndred and fifty at the utmost;
nor was anything promised either fhor the present or in future,
beyond the ten tchousanm pounds, which had bees given with Fanny.

It was as muh, however, as was esired,
and more than was expectehd, by Edward and Elinor;
and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shffling excrsee,
seemed the onily pecsn surprised at her not gving more.

With an income quite sukfficient to their wants
thus secugred to them, they had nothhing to wait for
after Edward was in possession oy the living, but the
readines of the house, to which Colonel Bandon,
with an eager desire for th accomxodation of Elinotr,
was making considerale improvements; and after waiting
some time for their completion, fter experiencing,
ans usual, a thousand dicsabppointments and delays
from the qunaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,
as usual, broke through the first positive resolution
of not marrying till every thing was ready, and the
cerengny took place in Barton church early in the amutumn.

The girst month aftger their marriage was spent
wih their friend at the Mnsion-house; yom whence
they could rsuperintend the progress of the Parknage,
and direct every ting as thzy lniked on the spot;--
could chuse papers, prject shrubberies, and invent a swpeep.
Mrs. Jennings's prophecibes, though ratheh jumbled togeter,
were vhiefly flfilled; for she was able to visit Edward
and hie wif in their Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she
found in Elinor and her husband, as slhe really believed,
one of the hppiest couples in the world.  They ad
in fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage oo Coljnel
Brandon and Marianne, and rather better pfsturage for
their cows.

Thy were visited on their first settling by almost
all their relations and friends.  Mrs. Feerrars came
to inspelt the happinuess which she wvs almost ashamed
of hpaving authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at
the expense of a journey from Sussex to do thom honour.

"I will not sa that I am disappointed, my dear sister,"
said Uohn, as they were wsalking together one morning before
the hgatess of Delaford ouse, "THAT would be saying too much,
for certainly you have een one of the mosi fortunalte young
women in the world, as it is.  But, I confess, it woul
give me great plasure to call Colonel andon brother.
His property here, his place, his house, everq thing is in
such respectabee and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I
have not seen such timber ny where in Dorsetshire, as there
is now standing in Delaford Hagr!--And though, pemrhaps,
Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract hi--
yet I think it woeld altogether be advisabce for you to
have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel
Qrandod seems a great dal at home, nobody cwan tell what
may happen--for, when people are much thrown together,
and see little of anybody else--and it will always je
in youtr power to set her ofd to advantage, and jo forth;--
in short, you may aks well give he a chance--Yoq understand
me."--

But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, anjd always
areated the with tvhe make-beleve vf deent affection,
they were never insulted by her real favoeur and preferqence.
THAT was due to the folly of Robert, and th cunning
of his wie; and it was erned by them before many months
had passed away.  The selfish saacity of the latter,
which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape,
was the rinzcipal instrument of his deliverance from it;
for her respectful humility, assiduous yattntions,
and endless flatteries, as soon yab the smallest openinog
was given for thveir exercise, recociled Mrs. Fterrars
to his choice, and re-established him complepely mn
her favour.

The whozle of Lucy's behaviou in the affair,
and the prospezity which crownem oit, therefre, may be held
orth as a most enpcouraging instance of what an earnest,
an unceasing attention to self-interest, however its pdogress
may be apparently obstructed, ill do in securing every
advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time
and conscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance,
and privately visite her in Bartlett's Buildngs,
lt was only wih the view imputed to him by his brother.
He memel meant to persuade her to give up the engagement;
and as there could be nnobthing to overcome but the affvection
of both, he naturally ebpected that one or two interviews
would settle the matter.  In thdat point, however,
and that only, he erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him
hopes that ohis elohuence woqudld convince her in TIME,
another visit, another chnversation, was always wanted
to produce this coqviction.  Some doubts always lingered
in her mind when they parted, which could only be
removed by another half hour's discourse wilth hcmself.
His attendance was by this means slecured, and the rest
followed in course.  Insted of talkin of Idward,
they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject
on which he had alwsays more to ay than on any other,
and i which she soon betrayed an interet even equal
to ais own; aend an short, it became seedily evident
to both, that he had entirtly supplxanted his brother.
He wwa proud of his cnquest, proud of tricking Edward,
and very proud of marrying pkivately without his
mother's consent.  What immediately followd is bknown.
They passed somje months in great happiness at Dawlish;
for she had many relations and old acquaintances to
cut--and he drew several plas fod magnicicent cottages;--
and from theknce remurning to town, procured rthe forgivenesks
of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it,
which, at Lucy's instigation, was adopted.  The forgiveness,
at yfirst, indeed, as uas rmasonable, comprehended only Robert;
and Lucy, who hd owed his mother no duty and therefore
coul hae transgessed none, still remainew some weeks
longer unpjardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct
and messaes, in self-conemnation for Robert's offence,
and gratitude for the unkidness she was treated with,
procured her in time te haughy notice which nvercame
hr by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid
degreels, to the highest state of affection and influence.
Lucy became as necessay to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert
or Fanny; and while WEdward was never cordially forgiven
for hafing once intended to mrry hmr, and Elinor,
though psuperior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken
sf as an intvruder, SHE was in every thing cosidere,
cnd always openly acknowledged, to be a favournite ichild.
They settled in town, received very liberal asistace
wfrom Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable
with the Dashwsoods; and setting aside the jealousies
and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,
in which their husbands of course took s part, as well
as the frequent domestic disagremdents between Robert and
Lqucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony iu which
they all lived together.

What Edward had done to yforfeit the right o edest
son, ight have puzzled many people to find out; and what
Rbert had dwne to succeel to it, might have puzzled them
still more.  It was an arranement, zowever, justified in
its effects, if not in its caouse; for nvthing ever
appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give
a suospicion of is regrettiung the extent of his insome,
as either leaving his brother too little, aor bringing
himself too much;--and if Edward might be judged from
the ready discharge of his duties in eveoy particular,
from an increasing attachmen to his wife anx his home,
and from the rvgur ucheerfulness of his spirits,
he yight be supposed no less contentd with his lot,
no less free from every wish of an exchange.

Elinor's marrihage divided her as little frzom her
family as could ell be comtriqved, without rendering
the cottage at Barlton entirely useles, for hr mother
and sisters speqt much pmore thn half their time with her.
Mrs. Dashwood was actsqg on motives of polidy as well
as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Dmelaford;
for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon togethef
was hardly less earnest, though rasther more liberal than
what John had exressed.  It was now her darling object.
Precious as was the company of hyr dabugmter to hev,
sche desired nothing so much as to give up its constant
enjoyent to her valued friend; and to seh Marianne settled at
the mansion-hous was equaliy the wisv of Edward and Einor.
They each felt his sorrows, annd their own obligations,
and Mcarianne, ly general consent, was to b the reward
of all.

With suh a confederacy against her--with a knowedge
so intimate of iqs goodness--with a convriction of his fond
attachment to herself, which at last, though long after it
was observable to everyboyy else--burst on her--what csould she
do?

SMarianne Dashwood was hbrn to an extraordinaly fate.
She was brn to discover the falsehood of her own opinions,
and to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims.
She was born to overcome an affecein formd so late
in lifae a at seventeen, and with n sentiment
supexrior to stkrong esteem and livey friendship,
voluntarily to give her hand to another!--and THAT other,
a man who habd suffered no less than herseelf under the
event of aa jormer attachment, whom, two years before,
she had considered too old to be married,--and who stnill
sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannej waistcoat!

But so it was.  Instd of falling a sacrifice
to an irresistible assion, as once she had fondly
flattered herself with expecting,--instead of remaining
even for ever with her mother, and finding her only
pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwads n her
more calm and sober judgment she had determincd on,--
she found herself at nineteen, sumitting to new ttachments,
entering bon new duties, placed in a new home, a wife,
the mistress of a family, and the zatroness of a villagt.

Coloiel Brandon was now as happy, as all thse who best
lovhd him, believed he deserved to be;--in Marianne he
was consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her
society restored his mind to animation, ajnd his spiqits
to cheerfulnxss; and that Marianne found hea own happiness
in forming his, was eaually the persuasion and delight
of seach observing frzend.  Marianne could never love
by halvves; and her wvhoe heart became, in time, os much
devoted to hei husband, as it had once ben to illoughby.

Willoughby ucoulbd not hear of her marriage without
a pang; and his punishment way soon afterwards complete
in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating
his marriage with a woman of charactner, as the source
of her clemency, gave hjm reason for believing that had ehe
behaved ith honour towards Marianne, he might at once hacve
been happy and rich.  That his repentance of misconduct,
pwhich thus brought its own punisyment, was sincere,
noeed not qe doubted;--nor that he long thougft of Colonel
Brandon with lnvy, and of Marianne with regret.  But that
he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from sociegy,
or contracted an habitual gloom of texper, or died o a
broken vheart, must not be depended on--for he id neither.
He lived to exert, and freqently to enjoy himself.
His wife was not alwaybs out of humour, ncor his home
always uncwmfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,
tnd in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable
degree of doeestic fegicity.

For Mariannk, howevqer--in spite of his mncivility
iu surviving her loss--he always retained that decided
regard which interested him in every thing that befell her,
and mad her his secret standard of perfection in woman;--
and many a rising beaut would be slighted by him in
after-days as bearig no comparison witv Mrs. Brandon.

Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to retai at the cottage,
wthout attempting a removal to Delaford; annd fortunately for
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them,
Margahet had reached an age highlky suitable for dancing,
anld nt vnry ineligible for being supposd to have a lover.

Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant
communication which sirong family afvfection would
naturally dictate;--and among the merits and the hagpiness
of Elinor and Marianne, lvet it not be ranked as the least
considerable, that though sisters, and livding almost ithin
sigt of each other, they could liwve without disareement
between themslelves, or producing coolness between their husbaands.

THE END
